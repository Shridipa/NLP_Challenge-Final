    "content": "Dear Shareholders, This year, we celebrated the 25th anniversary of HCLTech going public. The company\u2019s growth has been nothing short of spectacular, establishing itself as one of the finest global corporations out of India with world-class corporate governance, sustainability and social responsibility at its core. We have set the benchmark with industry-leading Total Shareholder Returns and several firsts in the industry. Thank you for your support and trust throughout this exciting journey. FY25 marked another year of robust growth for HCLTech. Despite demand challenges, we achieved best-in-class growth for the second consecutive year. Our services revenue exceeded \u20b9100,000 crores, grew at 6.5% YoY, and have outperformed our comparable peers for the third year in a row. Our software business maintained over $1 billion annual recurring revenue. This highlights the strength of our differentiated portfolio that enables our clients navigate the rapid changes in the technology landscape led by technologies such as AI and quantum computing. We continue to invest aggressively in our technology capabilities. We have made significant progress by developing a full-stack AI portfolio that allows clients to innovate and deploy real-world solutions at scale. We are also ensuring that we deliver our AI capabilities ethically and responsibly. HCLTech is adopting AI widely across the organization and investing in upskilling employees in AI and allied technologies. Our focus on gender diversity has ensured a diversity rate of 29% across the company and 50% at the board level. We continue to provide platforms for more women leaders to build long-term careers with HCLTech. Sustainability remains a top priority for us and we have made considerable progress in our journey to becoming a net-zero emission company by 2040. In recognition of these efforts, HCLTech was included in the S&P Global Sustainability Yearbook for the third year in a row and received Gold status from EcoVadis, placing it among the top 5% companies globally. We were also ranked No. 3 in Brand Finance\u2019s Sustainability Perception Index in India. Our uncompromising approach to high standards of governance and integrity was recognized by Ethisphere, which named HCLTech one of the World\u2019s Most Ethical Companies 2025. This is the second year in a row we\u2019ve earned this accolade. HCLTech, through HCLFoundation and global CSR councils, has strengthened its social responsibility efforts. In India, we have increased HCLTech Grant outlay for FY26 by 45% to support innovative projects in water management, health, education and biodiversity. We have also pledged to lead the water stewardship in Yamuna basin as a part of the \u2018CEO Water Mandate Water Resilience Coalition\u2019. We believe these initiatives have the promise to deliver impact at scale and create replicable solutions. It\u2019s also heartening to note the enthusiastic response we have received for the HCLTech Americas Grant initiative that supports path-breaking climate action programs by NGOs in the Americas. Looking ahead, the demand environment is expected to remain challenging as clients continue to exercise caution due to uncertainties around global trade frameworks and geopolitical tensions. We remain focused on navigating these challenges and ensuring that HCLTech remains well-positioned to leverage the opportunities available. Technology evolution, driven by AI, is accelerating and the IT services industry is at an inflection point. Needless to say, the industry will need to reinvent itself to stay relevant. HCLTech is prepared to adapt to these shifts. On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank the HCLTech leadership team and the 223,000+ HCLTechies led by our Managing Director & CEO, C Vijayakumar, for their passion and commitment, which make HCLTech stand apart year after year.",

This marks the second consecutive year in which HCLTech has outperformed its comparable peers, underscoring the resilience of our all-weather portfolio, AI-led propositions and sharp focus on client excellence. Today, HCLTech has firmly established itself as the bellwether of the Indian IT services industry. Revenue for the year was \u20b9117,055 crores, a growth of 6.5%, while profit for the full year was \u20b917,390 crores, a growth of 10.8%. EBIT was \u20b921,420 crores, up 7% and EBIT margin was 18.3%. Services revenue was \u20b9105,398 crores, up 6.6%, while HCLSoftware continued to grow from strength to strength with revenue of \u20b912,049 crores, a growth of 5.2%. In terms of geographies, both our dominant markets, the US and Europe, each saw 5.2% growth, in constant currency (CC).

HCLTech was named as the world\u2019s fastest-growing IT services brand in 2025 by Brand Finance, with a brand value of $8.9 billion, up 17% YoY \u2013 a very proud moment for all of us. We were also the No. 1 India-headquartered company in TIME magazine\u2019s list of World\u2019s Best Companies 2024 and featured in Forbes list of World\u2019s Best Management Consulting Firms 2024. FY25 also saw us mark a very special milestone in our growth journey. This year we celebrated the 25th anniversary of HCLTech\u2019s IPO. Over the past 25 years, HCLTech has delivered industry-leading cumulative total shareholding return (TSR) with a CAGR of 20.6%. We pioneered the Engineering and R&D and Remote IT Infrastructure Management services in the Indian IT industry and also built the largest enterprise software product company out of Asia. Few Indian companies have had the privilege of creating such tremendous value for their investors, people, clients and the nation at large. In a rapidly evolving technology landscape, we have doubled down on investing in the upskilling of our people, offering them a culture in which they can grow and thrive. In FY25, we trained over 106,000 employees in AI/GenAI. We continue to have one of the lowest employee attrition rates in the industry and possibly the most stable leadership team. For the third consecutive year, HCLTech received the Global Top Employer recognition from Top Employers Institute, with a No. 1 rank in North America, Europe and APAC. We were also recognized by Forbes as one of the World\u2019s Best Employers for the fifth consecutive year, making us the only India-headquartered company in the professional services category to be among the global top 10 for five years in a row. HCLTech\u2019s balance sheet remained very healthy, driven by efficient capital management and cost controls. During FY25, ROIC was 37.9%, up 4.1%, and comparable to the best in the industry. The Operating Cash Flow to Net Income conversion was 129%, while Free Cash Flow to Net Income conversion was 123%. Diluted EPS for FY25 came in at \u20b964.09, a growth of 10.8%. The dividend payout for the full year was \u20b960 per share, representing 93.5% of net income, which again is among the best in the industry.

With a cumulative investment of over \u20b91,680 crores through the HCLFoundation, the interventions have positively impacted over 7.5 million lives across India. We are taking forward these learnings and capabilities to our global operations through grants and partnerships as well as employee volunteering. The HCLTech Grant Americas program has successfully completed two editions as part of the $5 million commitment to support climate action programs by NGOs across Americas. Going forward, we aim to expand these socially impactful solutions to more geographies. At this moment, we acknowledge the uncertainties in the business environment due to economic and trade related headwinds as well as continuing geopolitical challenges. While there are near-term challenges such as softness in discretionary spends, there are also opportunities as clients look to partners like HCLTech to help them navigate through these times by bringing together the best of technology and people and unlocking the \u2018art of the possible\u2019. With our differentiated portfolio and people, we remain optimistic and well-positioned for the large growth opportunities that lie beyond this immediate phase of turbulence.

They required an automation solution for their hardware testing process and chose to harness a GenAI platform to modernize, streamline and accelerate test automation. The goal was to ensure consistent output, increase efficiency, shorten turnaround time and control costs while adhering to quality and compliance standards. The client deployed AI Force, HCLTech\u2019s GenAI platform, revitalizing their software engineering and operations lifecycle. This led to script generation for core product lines, minimizing manual script creation time and providing textual summaries for easy understanding. Existing test cases were converted into a modern scripting language, ensuring compatibility with proprietary automation platforms. Multiple testing phases were supported, ensuring thorough coverage across all functionalities while secured online generative AI models were hosted in cloud servers and local AI models. The results included a 40% reduction in bandwidth usage for testing, improved quality of test scripts with precise comments and descriptions, significant reduction in debugging time and accelerated testing services with faster script generation, reduced review time and minor script revisions. Blending on-prem SLMs with cloud-based LLMs to assist healthcare specialists A leading healthcare provider in the US invested in a clinical library to offer healthcare specialists access to cutting-edge medical research, standard operating procedures, best practices and treatment protocols. They sought an AI-powered solution to enrich the clinical library with a patient-focused conversational interface, summarize patient medical history, offer evidence- based recommendations, ensure the system does not hallucinate, and anonymize and secure PII (personally identifiable information) data. We created a two-part solution with both on-prem and cloud-based processing. On-premise processing uses small AI models (SLMs) on specialized computers to process patient data and medical history locally, preventing patients from repeating their medical history multiple times. Cloud-based processing employs large language models (LLMs) to answer doctors\u2019 questions and provide real-time advice. This solution leverages advanced Retrieval Augmented Generation techniques to enhance similarity searches and develop specialized prompts for healthcare professionals. The solution led to an estimated annual savings of over $100 million, improved efficiency for over 10,000 clinicians, resulted in a better patient experience and established the system as a trusted advisor for clinicians.

This complex task involved addressing changing business requirements, legacy technical debt, cyber compliance and performance improvement. We successfully migrated on-prem applications, including Oracle JD Edwards, Oracle Hyperion, Oracle WebLogic, Oracle databases and various Oracle custom applications (APEX) to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). We implemented a \u2018Zero-Trust\u2019 security model for OCI and a \u2018Hub and Spoke\u2019 model to manage network resources efficiently, enhance security and facilitate connectivity in a hybrid and multicloud environment. Additionally, a roadmap was created for migrating Fonterra\u2019s HR applications to OCI while modernizing them to meet current and future business needs. Several custom applications were re-prioritized and re-classified as \u2018critical,\u2019 requiring changes to the application architecture for high availability and disaster recovery. These initiatives helped Fonterra achieve a 30% faster performance over on-prem data centers and a 60% reduction in Time to Recovery (TRO) for database recovery during crises. Fonterra\u2019s IT team can also focus on developing new applications, exploring emerging technologies and improving processes. FY25 Initiatives Throughout FY25, we introduced various innovative solutions, IPs, frameworks and partnerships. In Q1, we unveiled AI Foundry, an initiative poised to elevate AI effectiveness throughout enterprise value chains. In Q2, we amplified our standing with powerful alliances and product launches, such as our collaboration with Denodo and AWS, the introduction of a suite of Salesforce- based solutions to unfold GenAI capabilities and the enhancement of HCLTech iMRO/4 on SAP S/4HANA Cloud. In Q3, we enabled high-speed, low-touch migration to the latest version of Blue Yonder Warehouse Management with Advantage SPADE, our platform for application and digital enterprise transformation. We also launched our AI and Cloud Native Lab with SAP in Munich, Germany. Q4 of FY25 saw expanded partnerships, like the one with Microsoft, to transform contact centers with GenAI and cloud-based solutions. HCLTech and Salesforce are partnering to bring Agentic AI to PenFed Credit Union, America\u2019s second-largest federal credit union, accelerating its journey toward enhanced member engagement and operational efficiency. \u201c Working collaboratively with HCLTech to get key resources and insight to best practices, particularly around APEX and JDE, was ultimately the key to success and strengthens our ongoing partnership.

Robinson, one of the world\u2019s largest logistics platforms, needed a central repository to collect and catalog each customer\u2019s needs and related solutions. Seeking to streamline several separate systems, the company selected HCLTech to implement Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales, including Power Apps and Power BI solutions. HCLTech built a Power Apps tool within Dynamics that works as a standalone app, allowing salespeople to focus entirely on the customer while collecting data vital to developing tailored solutions. To ensure this data is useful, the team developed a Power BI report called Wallet Share, which presents the information meaningfully and actionably. We also trained approximately 70 C.H. Robinson employees, mainly members of the leadership team, to promote user adoption. The impact of these solutions included a significant reduction in time spent searching for leads, achieving ROI breakeven in 11 months (against a target of 18 months), 500 daily launches of the Wallet Share app and 14,000 qualification activities in just the first six months. \u201c When I look across this broad relationship with Microsoft and HCLTech \u2013 and all the things we\u2019re thinking about, the future of the cloud, the future of AI, the things that we can pull back into Dynamics \u2013 these are going to change the lives of our sales force and make us a better company to sell for and a better company to buy from.

Clearing the Water: Fisherfolk\u2019s fight against invasive weeds For the 800 inland fishing families of Vembanad Lake at Ernakulam, Kerala, invasive water hyacinth threatens their livelihood, clogging waters, damaging nets and entangling boat propellers. Project Vembanad\u2019s Macro Fight (VMF), funded by HCLTech India Grant, empowers fisherfolk to reclaim their waters. Through regular weed removal at Njanodaya Fish Landing Center, the community actively clears the infestation, ensuring uninterrupted fishing.

    "content": "Business Strategy Strategy helps an organization to make choices and, more importantly, trade-offs. An effective strategy aligns stakeholders \u2014 clients, employees, partners, society and shareholders \u2014 to pursue shared goals of success and value creation. This shared focus ensures mutual interlocking and reinforcement of numerous decisions made daily across various aspects of the business. The key to the success of any strategy is to ensure the right choices are made consistently by all stakeholders by articulating the strategy clearly. For over four decades, HCLTech has built a culture of empowerment and innovation. Our leaders play a crucial role in translating strategy into practical, flexible guidelines that can be easily followed and implemented by everyone. To unleash the creative potential of our people, our strategic framework has remained simple and clear, aligned to the art of the possible. This simple yet effective approach ignites passion and ownership among our employees. We set forth a small set of priorities vital for our success and empower our people to execute them with enthusiasm and boldness. Aligned to this approach, we have our five medium-term strategic objectives: \u2022 Leadership through differentiated services and products leveraging our engineering pedigree \u2022 Employer of choice for professional services talent across chosen geographies \u2022 Preferred digital and AI partner for Global 2000, equivalent and emerging enterprises in chosen markets \u2022 Weave ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) into business strategy \u2022 Continue to deliver top quartile TSR (Total Shareholder Return) over the medium-term These medium-term strategic objectives (SOs) address the critical components necessary for business success, ensuring that all aspects of the organization, including goals, resources and activities, are coordinated and aligned to achieve the desired outcomes. We regularly assess and update our strategic objectives to ensure they remain relevant, leading to revisions in FY25. We have expanded further on each of these strategic objectives in the Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) section. The underlying principles that guide us in pursuing and attaining these strategic objectives are as follows: \u2022 Our culture of empowerment and innovation - Our commitment to excellence is deeply embedded in our cultural DNA. Our culture combines optimism with realism, driving passion and innovation. \u2022 Talent is at the center of every decision \u2013 Our employee value proposition, \u2018Find your Spark,\u2019 aims to inspire and empower employees by aligning our business model and talent strategy with their aspirations. We focus on creating enriching experiences and a next-gen work environment to help employees reach their full potential. \u2022 Enablement to drive execution - HCLTech ensures strategic objectives are clear and achievable by breaking them into specific initiatives, more importantly supported by enablement frameworks and cross-functional collaboration. This approach aligns initiatives with broader objectives, driving organizational interlock, key to success and growth. \u2022 Beyond benchmarking - HCLTech uses benchmarking to identify and adopt best practices and drive strategic objectives, focusing on parameters like stakeholder satisfaction and financial performance. This approach aims to advance strategic objectives rather than just aligning with competitors. \u2022 Benefit from current and future opportunities - We use a structured approach to detect market disruptions early, converting risks into opportunities for both short-term and long-term growth. We continuously monitor market signals to identify and capitalize on opportunities across existing and new domains and act promptly to gain competitive advantage. \u2022 Rethink competitive advantage through non-linear approach - HCLTech is focusing on achieving non-linear growth by leveraging AI/GenAI and other emerging technologies to enhance client experiences, drive innovation and improve efficiency. The company aims to decouple revenue from traditional models through AI-driven innovation and integration of advanced technologies, fostering a dynamic and customer-centric ecosystem.",

This approach enables resilience and long-term stakeholder value. \u2022 Align the larger ecosystem to strategic objectives - We communicate our strategic goals and progress to key external stakeholders through regular updates and transparent reporting. This approach attracts clients, investors and partners, fostering trust, driving growth and aligning them with our long-term journey. Peter Drucker\u2019s epithet that \u201cstrategy is a commodity, execution is an art\u201d is often mentioned to reinforce the importance of culture in executing strategy. This assertion underscores the idea that while formulating a strategic plan is imperative, the true test lies in its implementation. The organizational culture sets the tone for how strategies are perceived, accepted and executed. At HCLTech, through the intelligent integration of both culture and strategy, we execute impeccably to supercharge progress.

HCLTech is committed to delivering top-quartile TSR and we have delivered the highest compound TSR among our peer group for the past decade, showcasing our dedication to long-term value creation. Our simple formula for delivering superior TSR performance includes driving profitable growth, expanding profitability, enhancing cash generation, improving capital allocation and strengthening our governance practices. We use this formula to review every business decision we make. Our sustainable growth strategy focuses on capturing opportunities globally and in FY25, we secured new deals TCV worth $9.3 billion. In the fast-changing technological landscape, our priorities include offering a range of differentiated products and services, targeting the right clients and markets, enhancing our domain capabilities and prioritizing client satisfaction. By staying relevant and integrating GenAI offerings, we have increased client trust and expanded our wallet share across service lines. Over the past decade, we achieved a CAGR of 10% in constant currency, consistently outperforming the industry. Our commitment to increasing profitability is driven by a multifaceted approach. Offering differentiated services and products and targeting the right clients and markets ensures better margins. We maintain an efficient workforce pyramid with a focus on entry-level hiring and improving utilization through expedited onboarding and timely training. This approach, coupled with upskilling and reskilling for future technologies, enhances our workforce\u2019s efficiency.

Our EBIT and NI for this fiscal year are $2.5 billion and $2 billion, representing an increase of 4.7% and 7.6%, respectively. Enhancing our cash generation has been a priority, achieved through superior working capital management, improving Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) and other processes related to the cash conversion cycle. By streamlining our invoicing processes and proactive collections, we have significantly improved our cash inflow and reduced working capital requirements. Our asset-light approach, with minimal CAPEX investment requirements, further bolsters free cash flow, enabling us to maintain robust liquidity. This effective cash conversion has not only strengthened our liquidity but also contributed to an industry-leading average FCF/NI conversion rate of 127% over the last five years. Looking ahead, we anticipate maintaining this strong cash conversion, ensuring continued financial stability and growth. HCLTech\u2019s prudent capital allocation strategy is focused on enhancing shareholder value through meticulous planning and strategic investments. By maintaining a strong focus on return ratios and continuously improving Free Cash Flow (FCF), the company ensures that its financial foundation remains robust. This allows for both organic and inorganic growth opportunities, dividends, share buybacks (if needed) and a healthy balance sheet. Investments are prioritized in high-growth areas such as AI/GenAI, digital, engineering, cloud services, cybersecurity, semiconductor and telecom, aligning with long-term strategic objectives.

HCLTech values regular communication with investors and analysts, making it a cornerstone of our governance philosophy. We recognize the significant contributions that investors and analysts bring to our business strategy through their valuable insights. To demonstrate our commitment to market engagement, we continuously benchmark and improve our disclosure norms, ensuring transparency and fostering trust. We also host regular sessions with investors and analysts. We hosted the latest one on August 28, 2024, at Mumbai, India and the presentation is available in our investor website. Our commitment to growth, profitability, cash generation, return ratios, prudent use of capital and strong governance will help us continue to deliver top-quartile TSR. Risk Management HCLTech recognizes the critical role of risk intelligence and management in achieving its strategic objectives, enhancing stakeholder value, maintaining strong governance, building business resilience and delivering high-quality services to its clients. Our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) is based on the ISO 31000:2018 Risk Management standard and the COSO ERM Integrated Framework. This enables us to systematically and proactively identify, assess, mitigate, monitor and report on enterprise risks that may impact our strategic and business objectives while maintaining the highest standards of corporate governance. We use an integrated risk intelligence framework to monitor and manage internal and external risks. We use PESTLE (political, economic, social, technological, legal, environmental) analysis to prepare for regulatory changes, socio-political shifts and emerging global challenges. This comprehensive approach enables us to navigate the various risks that could affect our strategic plans and business. Risk Governance and Oversight Our risk management organization integrates risk management practices seamlessly with our business strategy and operations: \u2022 Leadership and Framework: The Board of Directors and the Risk Management/Audit Committee lead the Risk Governance and Oversight function. They are pivotal in framing and reviewing our ERM policy and identifying and assessing HCLTech\u2019s key business risks. \u2022 Shared Responsibility: Senior executives and employees collectively bear responsibility for risk management. The ERM initiative is driven by the Risk and Compliance Apex Committee (RCAC), the Chief Risk Officer, a dedicated working group and designated risk owners across the organization. \u2022 Role of Risk Owners: Usually senior executives from a line of business (LOB) or corporate function, risk owners are responsible for mitigating specific risks. They implement mitigation strategies, coordinate risk management activities across their LOBs, functions and geographies and ensure efficient information flow to the working group.

    "content": "Strategic Risks Primary Risk Details Mitigation Business Model HCLTech operates in a fast-paced industry. An inability to keep up with changing client needs, attract quality talent and adapt to evolving operating models can affect business growth. Moreover, emerging technologies such as GenAI pose a threat to the existing business model and an opportunity to offer new services. \u2022 Our strategy office has developed a Strategic Risk & Opportunity Management (SROM) framework that helps to scan signals and identify risks and opportunities ahead of time. Such signals are evaluated for their strength, scope of impact, time horizon to impact etc. and are then planned through a strategic planning process and enabled for execution. Over the past few years, several key strategic initiatives across offerings, corporate functions, geo expansions, etc., have emanated from this framework. Portfolio Concentration HCLTech recognizes the risks associated with being concentrated in certain business segments, industry sectors and geographic regions. Any negative event impacting these areas could have a material impact on the company\u2019s performance. \u2022 As a best practice, we assess our portfolio for concentration risk at regular intervals on various dimensions. We use diversification as one of the key tools to mitigate risk and propel growth. Our recent geographic, vertical and client market expansions have been driven by this approach. \u2022 We try to maintain a healthy balance and avoid over- dependency across dimensions like verticals, clients, geographies and business segments. For example, our client base and revenue share across verticals are well spread. Top twenty clients contribute around 30% of our revenue and we have about 950 clients each offering over $1M. Many of these clients are G2000 or equivalent, giving us the opportunity to expand wallet share and mitigate concentration risk. We have reduced regional dependency by expanding into new geographies and have strategically strengthened and diversified our offerings, including our Software portfolio. Business Delivery HCLTech faces risks from constraints on service delivery due to technological limitations, pandemics, geopolitical developments and the lack of talent availability. Any of these factors can adversely impact the company. \u2022 HCLTech continuously monitors the global technology market and collaborates closely with advisors, clients, partners and governments to minimize risk related to its delivery model. \u2022 We leverage our COEs, internal innovation platforms, subject matter experts, practice teams and ecosystem partnerships to overcome technology-related delivery challenges. \u2022 We continue to expand our New Vistas (NV) and nearshore presence to access the best talent and develop service-delivery resilience. 87 HCL T ech",

    "content": "Primary Risk Details Mitigation Competition HCLTech operates in a fiercely competitive market with various companies vying for the same clients. Additionally, we face competition from management consulting, advisory firms and GCCs (Global Capability Centers) that are emerging as strong players. This increased competition could cause us to lose clients, market share and wallet share. \u2022 The most efficient service providers will continue to do well in this competitive yet large market. Diverse and differentiated offerings, execution and client satisfaction will be critical parameters for becoming enterprises\u2019 preferred partners. \u2022 HCLTech\u2019s dedication to nurturing its relationships with clients is reflected in our consistently high CSAT scores, which are well above the industry average year after year, reflecting our all-weather portfolio, our ability to adapt to contemporary trends and technologies to meet our clients\u2019 changing needs and our impeccable execution. \u2022 HCLTech adopts a flexible competition strategy by exploring mutually beneficial partnerships and alliances where permitted. We perceive these challenges as opportunities and have consistently monitored and adapted to them over the years including GCCs. Brand and corporate reputation HCLTech has a global footprint in sixty countries. The company is exposed to brand and corporate reputation risks through negative or inaccurate media reports and social media posts by internal and external stakeholders. The inability to track and respond in time to this potential negative communication can harm HCLTech\u2019s corporate reputation among key stakeholders such as clients, employees, investors and partners. This could lead to a loss of business from clients and reduced capacity to attract top talent. \u2022 The company partners with an online reputation management agency and deploys advanced digital tools to track mainstream and social media channels to monitor coverage and conversations relating to HCLTech. A social media policy is also available to employees on social media Dos and Don\u2019ts. \u2022 The company has implemented a robust crisis communications management framework to identify and respond to any potential crisis worldwide. HCLTech has a global crisis communications agency on record and PR agency partners in multiple GEOs that enable it to respond to any crisis 24/7.

    "content": "Primary Risk Details Mitigation AI/GenAI The development and deployment of AI services and solutions present substantial risks, including the potential loss of market leadership if advancements are not maintained. Competition is fierce, with clients creating their own AI capabilities, leading to reduced demand for professional services. As AI technologies evolve, automation may replace some tasks currently performed by humans, decreasing the need for certain services and affecting professional utilization rates. Additionally, shortages of AI-skilled talent, rising costs associated with hiring and retaining specialized AI SMEs and inefficiencies in integrating AI into existing workflows further amplify risks. The implementation of AI/GenAI applications presents both positive and negative risks. Some negative risks relate to concerns around bias, privacy, security, explainability and transparency. These applications can be used to process a vast amount of organizational data and may generate new data. In some cases, data may be inaccurate or imbalanced for underrepresented groups, be of inferior quality or lead to unauthorized access and loss. The output produced by AI can contain inaccuracies, compliance violations, copyright issues and breaches of contract that may result in harm to the organization and its stakeholders. Additionally, there is a concern that bad actors could use this technology to create convincing deepfakes of company representatives or brand assets, which could result in significant reputational harm. \u2022 We started our AI journey early, giving us a significant head start and allowing us to provide valuable AI solutions to our clients. Our practical portfolio of platforms, services and products helps clients quickly achieve their AI goals. By incorporating AI, GenAI and Agentic AI into our offerings, we drive innovation to keep clients competitive in an ever- changing market. We are committed to making substantial investments to expand our AI solutions and delivery capabilities, ensuring we remain the preferred partner for our clients. Additionally, we are implementing strategic initiatives like investing in AI/GenAI-powered Industry Focused Repeatable Solutions (IFRS) and collaborating with firms specializing in AI to fully harness AI\u2019s potential and strengthen our market leadership. \u2022 Recognizing the importance of skills development, the company has initiated comprehensive multi-level training programs to enhance AI literacy across the organization and train specialists in the design, development and implementation of AI systems. This aims to address talent shortages, control costs and ensure that professionals are trained in high-demand areas. \u2022 HCLTech has developed an enterprise-level strategy and AI Risk Management Framework, integrating best practices from global standards and guidelines, including the EU AI Act, NIST AS RMF and ISO/IEC 42001. Key components of the framework include: \u2013 Addressing potential strategic business risks and outlining mitigation measures \u2013 Emphasizing self-regulation and adherence to Responsible AI principles \u2013 We have established robust governance frameworks around AI/GenAI that enable responsible and ethical use of technology. \u2013 We have also established an Office of Responsible AI and Governance led by SMEs with experience in NIST frameworks, Europe AI Act, ISO, Risk and Compliance, ethics and bias mitigation. \u2013 Ensuring a seamless linkage between the AI development lifecycle and the AI Risk Management lifecycle \u2013 Crafting a detailed adoption roadmap for the framework \u2013 Providing clear usage guidelines for stakeholders \u2022 The AI Governance Committee, formed at the HCLTech leadership level, monitors the framework to ensure alignment and compliance. 89 HCL T ech",

    "content": "Financial Risks Primary Risk Details Mitigation Default or Credit HCLTech\u2019s credit risk is concentrated in cash and bank balances, intercorporate deposits, customer receivables, finance lease receivables, investment securities and derivative instruments. All financial instruments mentioned above carry a risk of nonperformance by counterparties. \u2022 During the pre-contracting stage of the sales cycle, HCLTech assesses the clients\u2019 credit rating and financial reliability when investments or extended payment terms are involved. In the post-contracting stage, we continuously monitor our clients\u2019 resilience by tracking and analyzing their financial reliability, financial performance, published credit ratings, economic trends, historical debts and customer receivables. This continuous monitoring process significantly helps mitigate credit risks for the company. Currency HCLTech generates most of its revenue from clients outside of India and receives payments primarily in foreign currencies. The company\u2019s clients are primarily corporations based in the US, Europe and other geos and its receivables are concentrated here. Similarly, as HCLTech has delivery teams based in various countries, most of its costs are also denominated in foreign currencies. This situation puts HCLTech at risk of economic loss due to changes in exchange rates. \u2022 HCLTech uses foreign exchange forward contracts and a combination of options to mitigate the risk of foreign currency fluctuations on its net receivables/payables and forecasted transactions in certain currencies. \u2022 The company\u2019s Board establishes prudent governing policies and processes that determine the duration of hedges, the percentage of risk to be covered and the counterparty risk to be assumed. Acquisition and Integration HCLTech makes strategic acquisitions on an ongoing basis. The success of these acquisitions hinge on effective integration and synergy realization. Internal factors, as well as external factors beyond our control, can also play a role. These factors may include the risk of impairing goodwill, failed synergies and other intangibles if integration is not managed effectively. Additionally, a lack of integration process can limit the ability to capture synergy benefits. \u2022 Our governance program includes a robust mechanism to ensure regular reviews at multiple stages, starting from the deal stage to integration, with participation from Line of Business leadership to Executive Management to the Board of Directors, to address issues effectively. \u2022 HCLTech\u2019s robust integration and performance management framework enables the acquired businesses and HCLTech to achieve the acquisition objectives.

Changes to tax laws in India and other countries where HCLTech has a significant presence could impact the company\u2019s effective tax rate. As HCLTech operates in multiple jurisdictions, transfer pricing arrangements among legal entities in these regions are subject to review by various tax authorities. \u2022 HCLTech employs specialized tax teams that keep abreast of the latest tax developments in different countries, seek advice and support from external professional firms/consultants/lawyers and implement appropriate tax planning strategies based on changes in tax laws. \u2022 To mitigate tax risks associated with transfer pricing, we have established advance pricing agreements in several countries and periodically review them with external consultants. Primary Risk Details Mitigation Talent Management and Development Managing talent and meeting the ever-increasing demand for talent poses a significant ongoing risk to HCLTech. We face the risk of failing to fulfill resource demands due to a talent shortage, which could negatively impact top-line growth and organizational expansion. Furthermore, the risk of higher attrition rates could equally affect delivery capability and growth plans. Additionally, legislative changes restricting work visa availability and deglobalization could have a further impact. \u2022 HCLTech has developed a robust process for hiring and making talent productive worldwide. Our comprehensive training strategy is designed to meet the needs and goals of all employees, encompassing professional, technical, functional and leadership development. This approach is crucial for mitigating the risk of an unprepared leadership pipeline due to insufficient development and succession planning. \u2022 We have implemented various initiatives to attract, engage and retain a stable, content and diverse multi-generational employee pool. \u2022 To mitigate the potential effects of legislative actions, we have thoughtfully reduced our reliance on work visas by recruiting more local talent.

    "content": "Primary Risk Details Mitigation Service Delivery Commitments HCLTech recognizes the risk of failing to comply with terms and conditions, including meeting contractual commitments and service level agreements (SLAs) with its clients. This is considered a significant enterprise risk, emphasizing the need to effectively identify, monitor and report on SLAs to relevant stakeholders. The COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical dynamics, the Russia- Ukraine conflict, the Israel-Palestine conflict and related events have highlighted the disruptions resulting from supply-side shortages and logistics-capacity constraints. \u2022 HCLTech employs an integrated business planning and execution process in which the sales and delivery teams regularly engage with clients to ensure the seamless execution of engagements within SLAs. The company has a robust cadence mechanism, CREST, with extensive leadership participation to identify and address any issues ahead of time. We also use account customer satisfaction (ACSAT) at an account level and project customer satisfaction (PCSAT) at the project level to mitigate the risk of failure to meet service delivery commitments. \u2022 We have implemented a robust vendor risk management framework to minimize the potential business impact to us and our clients arising from breaches and liabilities that may occur when leveraging third or fourth parties (vendors, suppliers, contractors, or service providers). Cost Management HCLTech recognizes effective cost management as a crucial aspect of our operations, particularly during periods of higher inflation. Poor budget planning, inaccurate cost estimation and external factors such as rising costs of talent and other resources can all contribute to the risk of cost overruns. \u2022 HCLTech\u2019s control processes include regular benchmarking and delivery model optimization to maintain cost competitiveness. We also have a seamless view of demand and supply to ensure any genuine cost increases due to external factors are passed on to clients through adjustments in pricing structure. Additionally, Project Ascend is being implemented as an internal transformative initiative to improve cost structure and operational efficiencies. Internal Controls and Processes Lack of processes or poorly designed processes and controls in HCLTech can lead to operational inefficiency and impact business. \u2022 HCLTech maintains a comprehensive array of robust internal frameworks and processes, which are subject to extensive monitoring to assess their efficacy. In addition, we also conduct regular audits to ensure both the quality of our processes and compliance with the required standards. Operational Agility HCLTech faces a fundamental risk if it is not operationally agile. This means it may not be able to respond and adapt to changing market conditions or meet various stakeholder preferences, including clients, employees and the community. This lack of agility could result in significant financial losses and negatively impact the company\u2019s brand. \u2022 HCLTech has strong internal processes and efficient resources to ensure smooth operations and high agility. Our Ideapreneurship-led culture empowers leadership and managers to respond to changing market conditions in line with our purpose and strategic objectives. Our history of success through this approach is evident in our well-trained people who know how to be agile without increasing our exposure to risk. Management Discussion and Analysis (MDA) 92",

Physical risks include extreme weather events like droughts, floods, cyclones, wildfires and heat stress. Transition risks include changes in policy and regulatory context leading to increased carbon prices, taxes and cost of doing business. It also includes business continuity risks. The oppo/r_t.ligaunity to be climate resilient and climate positive includes developing climate resilient processes, operations, value chain, products, services and solutions that not only suppo/r_t.liga our journey but also that of our clients and pa/r_t.liganers. As a pa/r_t.liga of our net- zero strategy, HCLTech is commi/t_t.ligaed to limiting greenhouse gas emissions aligned to the 1.5\u00baC pathway by 2030 and to achieving net zero by 2040. A clear roadmap is planned towards this commitment. We are making steady progress on this roadmap. HCLTech is also developing products, services and solutions that help clients and pa/r_t.liganers meet their commitments on climate change. HCLTech has continued its journey to identify and execute projects to work with communities to move towards a climate resilient future. The financial implications of climate change risk are disruption to business operations and increased cost of doing business. The financial oppo/r_t.ligaunity of being climate resilient and climate positive is enhanced business continuity, robust operations, cost saving and increased business revenues.

HCLTech has implemented various energy efficiency initiatives to reduce energy consumption, water consumption and waste minimization. HCLTech has defined monitoring and governance systems covering all eco \u00afefficiency parameters. These are reviewed at regular intervals and budgets are allocated for pe/r_f.ligaormance improvement. Lower pe/r_f.ligaormance on eco \u00afefficiency carries the risk of increased costs of doing business. Improvement in eco \u00afefficiency directly leads to cost savings and resilient business operations. 3 Human Capital Risk and oppo/r_t.ligaunity HCLTech defines human capital as skills, knowledge and experience possessed by an employee or a team, that can be valuable to the organization. We require constant upskilling and reskilling of our employees to ensure we deliver top services to our clients in a rapidly evolving digital technology space. Human capital is an impo/r_t.ligaant risk as well as oppo/r_t.ligaunity for us. HCLTech has a clear institutional mechanism to map future skillset requirements and has programs for upskilling and reskilling employees. There are measurements used to gauge the pe/r_f.ligaormance of the initiative, which are reviewed periodically. The financial implication of the risk is potential loss of business oppo/r_t.ligaunity if adequate and appropriate human capital is not available. Readiness on human capital creates oppo/r_t.ligaunities to cater to client and business needs leading to revenue growth. 4 Local hiring Oppo/r_t.ligaunity Hiring local talent in places where we do business is an impo/r_t.ligaant risk and oppo/r_t.ligaunity for us. Hiring locally is not just the right thing to do, but an effective strategy to improve talent retention. It also conveys our commitment to the community that we are invested in that location. Across the globe, in the countries where we operate, we are investing in local talent. As a strategy HCLTech has expanded its offices to smaller cities (New Vistas) and provided a hybrid workspace to fu/r_t.ligaher enable people prospects. Improved talent retention and be/t_t.ligaer relations with the community and clients lead to steady long term revenue growth and ability to deliver on that growth.",

There is ample evidence to highlight that having diverse perspectives in a team creates be/t_t.ligaer work outcomes in addition to be/t_t.ligaer team coherence and has a positive impact on creativity, problem \u00afsolving and overall organizational success. HCLTech has clear policies, processes and governance structures to monitor the pe/r_f.ligaormance of our D&I strategy. We have an ESG and DEI Commi/t_t.ligaee set up in our Board to ensure a strategic focus. Goals and targets are identified and integrated into the pe/r_f.ligaormance evaluation of leaders. A separate team works on various initiatives to fu/r_t.ligaher our commitment. Absence of D&I robustness may lead to narrow perspectives that may impact quality and output of work. Robust presence of D&I may potentially lead to comprehensive solutions driving be/t_t.ligaer business outcomes in addition to inclusive workplace. Inclusive workplace may drive be/t_t.ligaer productivity, innovation and retention of talent. 6 Talent a/t_t.ligaraction and retention Risk and Oppo/r_t.ligaunity Meeting the increasing demand for new talent poses a significant risk and a unique oppo/r_t.ligaunity. The increasing shifts globally towards the adoption of digital solutions and increasing range and diversity of technology solutions have put the focus on striving the right balance between demand and supply of appropriate skillsets. We view it as an oppo/r_t.ligaunity to align our work culture with global trends, thereby enhancing employee retention while also increasing their efficiency. HCLTech\u2019s strategy is to focus on building the workplace of tomorrow\u2014one which promotes equality of oppo/r_t.ligaunity, a collaborative and transparent culture and deploys a robust training strategy designed to meet the development needs of employees at all levels. The company provides employees with progressive career paths through internal oppo/r_t.ligaunities. Failing to effectively a/t_t.ligaract and retain talented individuals can result in missed oppo/r_t.ligaunities for growth and innovation, leading to decreased productivity and competitiveness. Additionally, the costs associated with recruiting, onboarding and training new employees are significant. On the other hand, successfully a/t_t.ligaracting and retaining the right talent leads to direct pe/r_f.ligaormance gains and ability to cater to new growth oppo/r_t.ligaunities leading to be/t_t.ligaer revenues.",

Good workspaces, wellness spaces, creches, gyms, etc., are integral pa/r_t.ligas of our offices. It is also impo/r_t.ligaant to create an environment that is safe where employees have the confidence and trust to repo/r_t.liga on any kind of discrimination or harassment. We ensure that our offices are designed and planned to ensure the comfo/r_t.liga of our employees. We have clear policies and processes to prevent any discrimination and harassment in our workplaces. These are communicated regularly and employees are encouraged to repo/r_t.liga on any incidents. We have tracking mechanisms to ensure we take preventive steps. Independent investigation of incidents is also ensured. The comfo/r_t.liga and trust of the employees in a good work environment results in dedicated employees. Hence the financial impact is a result of healthy and safe employees pe/r_f.ligaorming to their full potential. A workplace incident can result in a loss of reputation to the organization and this can result in potential loss of oppo/r_t.ligaunities. 8 Citizenship Oppo/r_t.ligaunity Corporate citizenship is not just an oppo/r_t.ligaunity for HCLTech but rather it is the backbone of the organization. It is our responsibility to the community in which we operate. HCLFoundation in India and the various employee councils around the world highlight our focus. Apa/r_t.liga from the positive impact on the community members/program pa/r_t.ligaicipants, our initiatives demonstrate our commitment to the communities in which we operate. Outcomes resulting from improved trust and credibility in the community can bring potential financial oppo/r_t.ligaunities for HCLTech.",

As a leader in IT services, HCLTech is uniquely positioned to assist its clients to innovate through advanced technology and digitalization while being responsible in its usage. HCLTech already works with clients on several sustainable solutions. Therefore, we created a dedicated team which works with various sector heads to identify oppo/r_t.ligaunities related to sustainability and create appropriate sustainability \u00afrelated solutions for our clients. The direct financial impact will emerge from the creation of new oppo/r_t.ligaunities with clients. Indirect benefits include the creation of environmental and social capital.",

This has led to a greater focus on the need to build robust, secure and sophisticated solutions that are secure, safe and robust. Data privacy and security are critical features. HCLTech ensures a globally interconnected oversight framework involving governance, policies, procedures, training and awareness programs, global privacy impact assessments, privacy by design, data mapping, third \u00afpa/r_t.ligay contractual oversight, incident management and a mechanism for monitoring regulatory compliance for every geography. Our Crisis & Resilience program highlights our focus on integrating resilience as an intrinsic pa/r_t.liga of our business operating model and seeks to embed \u201cresilience by design\u201d across the dimensions of work, personnel, workplace, business operations, technology, supply chain and leadership. Our Information and cybersecurity program ensures a strong security posture for HCLTech and our clients. Our security posture has been validated by independent, industry recognized ce/r_t.ligaifications and a/t_t.ligaestation standards, including qua/r_t.ligaerly oversight by the Board. We also have cyber insurance that covers different types of breaches and cyber events. Any incident has a direct impact on that specific project with the client or on HCLTech as an organization. It may lead to regulatory implications, reputational challenges and financial implications.",

Sustainable Procurement Risk and Oppo/r_t.ligaunity For sustainability to be effective at derisking the organization, it needs to be deployed beyond our internal operations to cover our supply chain. A supply chain that is at odds with our sustainability goals and priorities is a risk to our achievement of our goals. Through responsible sourcing, collaboration with upstream and downstream pa/r_t.liganers and improving supply chain governance, HCLTech has integrated sustainability into its procurement process. Both the Supplier Code of Conduct and Procurement Policy has integrated sustainability requirements. ESG has been incorporated as a risk domain in the Vendor onboarding process for new vendors. HCLTech has also conducted risk evaluation of the supply chain based on ESG guidelines and identified categories and vendors who will be audited. The audit requirements are integrated into the Vendor Risk Management program (R&C). Non \u00afadherence to ESG guidelines in the supply chain can lead to associated reputation damage and thwa/r_t.liga progress on our sustainability goals. Integration of our sustainability goals in our supply chain increases our effectiveness in meeting these goals and leads to greater positive impact.",

HCLTech has stipulated policies, processes and systems to ensure ethical conduct and strong governance. Governance and Ethics are the foundations of the HCLTech culture. We structure our governance to permeate ethical conduct throughout the organization. Our strong governance and ethical culture ensure our viability over the long term. The Code of Business Ethics and Conduct (COBEC) is our principal document that outlines the way HCLTech employees should conduct business. The whistle \u00afblower policy and various other repo/r_t.ligaing channels help to identify any challenges that need to be corrected. The Board reviews this periodically through the Audit Commi/t_t.ligaee. We are focused on both current and future regulations to ensure we are fully prepared for any change. Non \u00afcompliance with corporate governance regulations can have several financial implications and reputational consequences. Regulatory actions taken against the company can lead to penalties, fines and legal expenses, negatively impacting its financial pe/r_f.ligaormance. Moreover, there is a risk associated with incidents that may not be regulatory in nature but still raise questions about the ethical conduct of the business.",

What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis by the entity? HCLTech has established, implemented, and maintained a formal process for hazard identification, risk assessment and control to effectively manage workplace and safety hazards across our facilities. HCLTech uses the failure mode effect analysis (\u201cFMEA\u201d) to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non- routine basis. After risks are identified, the following steps are taken: \u25cf Risk Evaluation: The identified risks are assessed using the Risk Priority Number (RPN), which considers the Severity, Occurrence, and Detection of each failure mode. \u25cf Action Plan Development: High-priority risks are addressed by creating mitigation strategies, such as design changes, process improvements, or additional controls. \u25cf Implementation of Actions: The corrective measures are applied to reduce the likelihood of failure, minimize impact, or improve detection methods. \u25cf Re-evaluation: The updated process or design is reviewed, and a new RPN is calculated to confirm the effectiveness of the actions taken. The above steps ensure a continuous cycle of improvement to minimize risks and enhance system reliability. c. Whether you have processes for workers to repo/r_t.liga the work-related hazards and to remove themselves from such risks. (Y/N) Yes, we have established processes for workers to repo/r_t.liga work-related hazards and remove themselves from risky situations. Key steps involved are as follows: \u25cf Hazard Identification: Workers are encouraged to identify and recognize potential hazards in the workplace. This is done through regular inspections, observations, and feedback. \u25cf Repo/r_t.ligaing Channels: Workers can repo/r_t.liga hazards through various channels such as direct communication with supervisors, dedicated safety commi/t_t.ligaees, or anonymous repo/r_t.ligaing systems. \u25cf Documentation: Proper documentation of the hazard is crucial. This includes detailing the nature of the hazard, its location, and any immediate risks it poses. \u25cf Immediate Action: Workers have the right to remove themselves from dangerous situations if they believe there is an imminent risk to their health or safety. \u25cf Follow-Up: After a hazard is repo/r_t.ligaed, there is a follow-up process to ensure that the issue is resolved and that the workplace is safe. \u25cf Training and Education: Regular training sessions are conducted to educate workers on how to identify, repo/r_t.liga, and handle workplace hazards effectively. d.

Describe the processes for identifying key stakeholder groups of the entity. HCLTech follows a structured and inclusive process for identifying key stakeholder groups. The company has unde/r_t.ligaaken a comprehensive mapping exercise to identify all relevant stakeholders: \u25cf Internal stakeholders such as employees \u25cf External stakeholders including clients, suppliers, investors, regulators, NGOs, and local communities \u25cf Indirect stakeholders such as future generations and natural ecosystems The stakeholder identification and engagement approach are built on three core dimensions: \u25cf Influence \u2013 their ability to shape or be influenced by the company\u2019s business decisions \u25cf Impact \u2013 the extent to which they are affected by, or can affect, the company\u2019s operations \u25cf Expe/r_t.ligaise \u2013 their technical knowledge or representative capacity relevant to ESG issues Engagements are designed and unde/r_t.ligaaken based on the materiality and need for consultation. These include both targeted methods (such as interviews and workshops) and broader periodic consultations, as appropriate and the frequency of engagement is predicated or scheduled as per the mutual needs of the stakeholders. Insights and outcomes from these engagements are disseminated across relevant teams within the organization to ensure timely feedback and resolution for stakeholders. This robust engagement mechanism has enabled HCLTech to align its ESG focus with its strategic framework \u2013 Act, Pact, and Impact. For the company, stakeholder engagement is not a one-time activity, but a continuous process that suppo/r_t.ligas the understanding and fulfilment of stakeholder expectations.",

    "content": "244Standalone Financial Statements Independent Auditor\u2019s Repo/r_t.liga To the Members of HCL Technologies Limited Repo/r_t.liga on the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements Opinion We have audited the standalone financial statements of HCL T echnologies Limited (the \u201cCompany\u201d) which comprise the standalone balance sheet as at 31 March 2025, and the standalone statement of profit and loss (including other comprehensive income), standalone statement of changes in equity and standalone statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the standalone financial statements, including material accounting policies and other explanatory information. In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (\u201cAct\u201d) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at 31 March 2025, and its profit and other comprehensive loss, changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date. Basis for Opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under Section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those SAs are fu/r_t.ligaher described in the Auditor\u2019s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements section of our repo/r_t.liga. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Cha/r_t.ligaered Accountants of India together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the standalone financial statements. Key Audit Ma/t_t.ligaer Key audit ma/t_t.ligaers are those ma/t_t.ligaers that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period. These ma/t_t.ligaers were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these ma/t_t.ligaers. Evaluation of tax positions and litigations See Note 1(h) and 3.27 to standalone financial statements The key audit ma/t_t.ligaer How the ma/t_t.ligaer was addressed in our audit The Company is required to estimate its income tax liabilities in accordance with the tax laws applicable in India. Fu/r_t.ligaher, there are ma/t_t.ligaers of interpretation in terms of application of tax laws and related rules to determine current tax provision and deferred taxes. The Company has material tax positions and litigations on a range of tax ma/t_t.ligaers. This requires management to make significant judgments to determine the possible outcome of unce/r_t.ligaain tax positions and litigations and their consequent impact on related accounting and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. In view of the significance of the ma/t_t.ligaer we applied the following audit procedures in this area, among others to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence: \u25cf testing the design, implementation and operating effectiveness of the Company\u2019s key controls over identifying unce/r_t.ligaain tax positions and ma/t_t.ligaers involving litigations. \u25cf obtaining details of tax positions and tax litigations for the year and as at 31 March 2025 and holding discussions with designated management personnel. \u25cf assessing and analysing select key correspondences with tax authorities and inspecting external legal opinions obtained by management for key unce/r_t.ligaain tax positions and tax litigations.",

Our opinion on the standalone financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the standalone financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the standalone financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have pe/r_f.ligaormed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to repo/r_t.liga that fact. We have nothing to repo/r_t.liga in this regard. Management\u2019s and Board of Directors\u2019 Responsibilities for the Standalone Financial Statements The Company\u2019s Management and Board of Directors are responsible for the ma/t_t.ligaers stated in Section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation of these standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view of the state of affairs, profit/loss and other comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under Section 133 of the Act. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the standalone financial statements, the Management and Board of Directors are responsible for assessing the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, ma/t_t.ligaers related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. The Board of Directors is also responsible for overseeing the Company\u2019s financial repo/r_t.ligaing process. Auditor\u2019s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the standalone financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor\u2019s repo/r_t.liga that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone financial statements. As pa/r_t.liga of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.",

Management\u2019s and Board of Directors\u2019 Responsibilities for Internal Financial Controls The Company\u2019s Management and the Board of Directors are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note. These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to company\u2019s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Act. Auditor\u2019s Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal financial controls with reference to financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note and the Standards on Auditing, prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and pe/r_f.ligaorm the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements were established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects. Our audit involves pe/r_f.ligaorming procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor\u2019s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the standalone financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Company\u2019s internal financial controls with reference to financial statements. Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with Reference to Financial Statements A company\u2019s internal financial controls with reference to financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial repo/r_t.ligaing and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal financial controls with reference to financial statements include those policies and procedures that (1) pe/r_t.ligaain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.",

Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with Reference to Financial Statements Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The Company was incorporated under the provisions of the Companies Act applicable in India in November 1991, having its registered office at 806, Siddha/r_t.ligah, 96, Nehru Place, New Delhi - 110019. The Company leverages its global technology workforce and intellectual prope/r_t.ligaies to deliver solutions across following ve/r_t.ligaicals - Financial Services, Manufacturing, Life Sciences & Healthcare, Public Services, Retail & CPG, T echnology & Services and T elecom, Media, Publishing and Ente/r_t.ligaainment. The standalone financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2025 were approved and authorized for issue by the Board of Directors on 22 April 2025. 1. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (a) Basis of preparation These standalone financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) prescribed under section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules as amended from time to time and presentation requirements of Schedule III (Division II) to the Companies Act, 2013, as applicable to the standalone financial statements. These standalone financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention on an accrual and going concern basis, except for the following assets and liabilities which have been measured at fair value: (a) Derivative financial instruments, (b) Ce/r_t.ligaain financial assets and liabilities (refer accounting policy regarding financial instruments), (c) Defined benefit plans The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these standalone financial statements are consistent with those of the previous year except where a newly issued accounting standard is initially adopted or a revision to an existing accounting standard requires a change in the accounting policy. All assets and liabilities have been classified as current and non-current as per the Company\u2019s normal operating cycle of 12 months. The statement of cash flows has been prepared under indirect method. The Company uses the Indian rupee (\u2018/uni20B9\u2019) as its repo/r_t.ligaing currency. All amounts are presented in crores of /uni20B9rounded to whole number and amounts less than /uni20B90.50 crores are presented as \u201c-\u201d . (b) Use of estimates, judgements and assumptions The preparation of standalone financial statements in conformity with Ind AS requires the management to make estimates and judgements that affect the repo/r_t.ligaed amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and other comprehensive income (OCI) that are repo/r_t.ligaed and disclosed in the standalone financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates are based on the management\u2019s best knowledge of current events, historical experience, actions that the Company may unde/r_t.ligaake in the future and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Changes in estimates are reflected in the standalone financial statements in the year in which the changes are made. Significant estimates, judgements and assumptions are used for, but not limited to, (i) Accounting for costs expected to be incurred to complete pe/r_f.ligaormance under fixed price projects and determination of stand-alone selling prices for each distinct pe/r_f.ligaormance obligation in contracts involving multiple pe/r_f.ligaormance obligations, refer note 1(f).

(xi) Provisions and contingent liabilities, refer note 1(p) and note 3.35. (xii) Impairment of investment in subsidiaries, refer note 1(s). (c) Business combinations and goodwill Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is the aggregate of the consideration transferred measured at fair value at the acquisition date. Acquisition related costs are expensed as incurred. Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer is recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. Contingent consideration classified as financial liability is measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in the statement of profit and loss. Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and any previous interest held, over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If the fair value of the net assets acquired is in excess of the aggregate consideration transferred, the excess is recognized as capital reserve after reassessing the fair values of the net assets. (d) Foreign currency and translation The financial statements are presented in Indian Rupee (/uni20B9), which is also the Company\u2019s functional currency. For each foreign operation, the Company determines the functional currency which is its respective local currency. T ransactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded by the Company at their respective functional currency spot rates at the date of the transaction. Foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities are translated to the relevant functional currency at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences arising on se/t_t.ligalement or translation of monetary items are recognized in the statement of profit and loss. Non-monetary assets and non-monetary liabilities denominated in a foreign currency and measured at historical cost are translated at the exchange rate prevalent at the date of initial transaction. Non-monetary assets and non-monetary liabilities denominated in a foreign currency and measured at fair value are translated at the exchange rate prevalent at the date when the fair value was determined. T ransaction gains or losses realized upon se/t_t.ligalement of foreign currency transactions are included in determining net profit for the year. Revenue, expenses and cash-flow items denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the relevant functional currencies using the exchange rate in effect on the date of the transaction. The translation of foreign operations from respective functional currency into INR (the repo/r_t.ligaing currency) for assets and liabilities is pe/r_f.ligaormed using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, and for revenue, expenses and cash flows is pe/r_f.ligaormed using an appropriate daily weighted average exchange rate for the respective years. The exchange differences arising on translation are repo/r_t.ligaed as a component of \u2018other comprehensive income (loss)\u2019 . On disposal of a foreign operation, the component of OCI relating to that pa/r_t.ligaicular foreign operation is recognized in the statement of profit and loss.

Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company\u2019s assumptions about current market conditions. The fair value hierarchy also requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The prescribed fair value hierarchy and related valuation methodologies are as follows: Level 1 - Quoted inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. Level 2 - Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-derived valuations, in which all significant inputs are directly or indirectly observable in active markets. Level 3 - Valuations derived from valuation techniques, in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable inputs which are suppo/r_t.ligaed by li/t_t.ligale or no market activity. In accordance with Ind AS 113, assets and liabilities at fair value are measured based on the following valuation techniques: (a) Market approach \u2013 Prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. (b) Income approach \u2013 Conve/r_t.ligaing the future amounts based on market expectations to its present value using the discounting method. (c) Cost approach \u2013 Replacement cost method. Ce/r_t.ligaain assets are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. These assets consist primarily of non- financial assets such as goodwill and intangible assets. Goodwill and intangible assets recognized in business combinations are measured at fair value initially and subsequently when there is an indicator of impairment, the impairment is recognized. A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market pa/r_t.ligaicipant\u2019s ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market pa/r_t.ligaicipant who would use the asset in its highest and best use. (f) Revenue recognition Revenue is recognized when, or as, control of a promised service or good transfers to a customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration (T ransaction price) to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring those products or services (Pe/r_f.ligaormance obligation). Revenue is recognized for any contract, once it is approved in writing, is legally enforceable, the rights of the pa/r_t.ligaies are identified, payment terms are defined, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. Revenue is measured based on the T ransaction price which is the consideration of the contract and is shown net of applicable taxes and adjusted for any variable consideration like volume discounts, service level allowances, incentive or any other discount.

Revenue from time-and-material, volume based, and transaction-based contracts is recognized as the related services are pe/r_f.ligaormed through effo/r_t.ligas expended, units serviced, number of transactions processed, etc. that correspond with value transferred to customer. Revenue related to fixed price contracts where pe/r_f.ligaormance obligations and control are satisfied over a period of time like technology integration contracts, complex network building contracts, system implementations and application development contracts is recognized based on progress towards completion of the pe/r_f.ligaormance obligation using percentage-of-completion method.

Revenue from distinct proprietary software is recognized at a point in time at the inception of the arrangement when right to use is granted to the customer. In the case of renewals of term licenses with existing customers, revenue from term license is recognized at a point in time when the renewal is agreed on signing of contracts. Revenue from suppo/r_t.liga and subscription (S&S) is recognized over the contract term on a straight-line basis as the Company is providing a service of standing ready to provide suppo/r_t.liga, when-and-if needed, and is providing unspecified software upgrades on a when-and-if available basis over the contract term. In case software are bundled with suppo/r_t.liga and subscription either for perpetual or term based license, such suppo/r_t.liga and subscription contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net fees paid by the customer to purchase the license and are generally recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual period that the suppo/r_t.liga services are provided.

Company uses cost plus expected margin to determine standalone selling price. Revenue from finance leases is recognized when all risks and ownership are transferred to the customer, with no remaining obligations that affect acceptance. Revenue is recognized at the fair value of the asset or, if lower, the present value of lease payments, discounted at a market interest rate. Interest from finance leases is recognized as other income on an accrual basis using the effective interest method. In instances when revenue is derived from sales of third-pa/r_t.ligay vendor services, material or licenses, revenue is recorded on a gross basis when the Company is a principal to the transaction and net of costs when the Company is acting as an agent between the customer and the vendor, once control of a promised good is transferred to a customer. Revenue from ce/r_t.ligaain activities in transition services in outsourcing arrangements are not capable of being distinct or represent separate pe/r_f.ligaormance obligation and is recognized over the period of the arrangement. Direct and incremental costs in relation to such transition activities which are expected to be recoverable under the contract are considered as contract fulfillment costs and classified as Deferred contract cost and recognized over the period of arrangement.

An onerous contract provision is recognized when the expected unavoidable costs of meeting the future obligations exceed the expected economic benefits to be received under a contract. Such provision, if any, is recorded in the period in which such losses become probable and is included in the cost of revenues. Contract assets are recognized when revenue recognized is more than billing and right to consideration is conditional upon factors other than the passage of time.

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for those temporary differences which originate during the tax holiday period and are reversed after the tax holiday period. For this purpose, reversal of timing differences is determined using first-in- first-out method. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each repo/r_t.ligaing date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realized. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or se/t_t.ligaled. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority. The effect of changes in tax rates on deferred income tax assets and liabilities is recognized as income or expense in the year that includes the enactment or the substantive enactment date. A deferred income tax asset is recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and tax losses can be utilized.

The residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of prope/r_t.ligay, plant and equipment are reviewed at each financial year-end and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate. (j) Intangible assets Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is measured at their fair value at the date of acquisition. Subsequently, following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amo/r_t.ligaization and impairment losses. Intangible assets are amo/r_t.ligaized over the useful life and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The amo/r_t.ligaization period and the amo/r_t.ligaization method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at the end of each repo/r_t.ligaing year. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pa/t_t.ligaern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset are considered to modify the amo/r_t.ligaization period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates. The amo/r_t.ligaization expense on intangible assets with finite lives is recognized in the statement of profit and loss.

Amo/r_t.ligaization of the asset begins when development is complete and the asset is available for use. It is amo/r_t.ligaized over the period of expected future benefit. Amo/r_t.ligaization expense is recognized in the statement of profit and loss. During the period of development, the asset is tested for impairment annually. (l) Borrowing costs Borrowing costs directly a/t_t.ligaributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use are capitalized as pa/r_t.liga of the cost of the asset. All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they occur. Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds. (m) Leases A lease is a contract that contains right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Company as a lessee Company is lessee in case of leasehold land, office space, accommodation for its employees & IT equipment. These leases are evaluated to determine whether it contains lease based on principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both lessees and lessors as defined in Ind AS 116. Right-of-use asset represents the Company\u2019s right to control the underlying assets under lease and the lease liability is the obligation to make the lease payments related to the underlying asset under lease. Right-of-use asset is measured initially based on the lease liability adjusted for any initial direct costs, prepaid rent, and lease incentives. Right-of-use asset is depreciated based on straight line method over the lease term or useful life of right-of-use asset, whichever is less. Subsequently, right-of-use asset is measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation, accumulated impairment losses, if any and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liability. The lease liability is measured at the lease commencement date and determined using the present value of the minimum lease payments not yet paid and the Company\u2019s incremental borrowing rate, which approximates the rate at which the Company would borrow, in the country where the lease was executed. The Company has used a single discount rate for a po/r_t.ligafolio of leases with reasonably similar characteristics. The lease payment comprises fixed payment less any lease incentives, variable lease payment that depends on an index or a rate, exercise price of a purchase option if the Company is reasonably ce/r_t.ligaain to exercise the option and payment of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Company exercising an option to terminate the lease. Lease liability is subsequently measured by increase the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability, reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payment made and remeasuring the carrying amount to reflect any reassessment or modification, if any.",

Assets given under finance lease are recognized as a receivables at an amount equal to the present value of lease receivables. After initial recognition, the Company appo/r_t.ligaions lease rentals between the principal repayment and interest income so as to achieve a constant periodic rate of return on the net investment outstanding in respect of the finance leases. The interest income is recognized in the statement of profit and loss. Initial direct costs such as legal cost, brokerage cost etc. are recognized immediately in the statement of profit and loss. When arrangements include multiple pe/r_f.ligaormance obligations, the Company allocates the consideration in the contract between the lease components and the non-lease components on a relative standalone selling price basis. (n) Inventories Stock-in-trade, stores and spares are valued at the lower of the cost or net realizable value. Cost includes cost of purchase and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of completion and estimated costs necessary to make the sale. Cost of stock-in-trade procured for specific projects is assigned by identifying individual costs of each item. Cost of stock-in-trade, that are interchangeable and not specific to any project and cost of stores and spare pa/r_t.ligas are determined using the weighted average cost formula. (o) Impairment of non-financial assets Goodwill Goodwill is tested annually on March 31, for impairment, or sooner whenever there is an indication that goodwill may be impaired, relying on a number of factors including operating results, business plans and future cash flows. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the Company\u2019s cash generating units (CGU) expected to benefit from the synergies arising from the business combination. A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or group of assets. Impairment occurs when the carrying amount of a CGU including the goodwill, exceeds the estimated recoverable amount of the CGU. The recoverable amount of a CGU is the higher of its fair value less cost to sell and its value-in-use. Value-in-use is the present value of future cash flows expected to be derived from the CGU. T otal impairment loss of a CGU is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to the CGU and then to the other assets of the CGU, pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the CGU. An impairment loss on goodwill recognized in the statement of profit and loss is not reversed in the subsequent period. Intangible assets and prope/r_t.ligay, plant and equipment Intangible assets and prope/r_t.ligay, plant and equipment are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in- use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the CGU to which the asset belongs.",

Contingent assets are neither recognized nor disclosed in the financial statements. (q) Retirement and other employee benefits (i) Provident fund: Employees of the Company receive benefits under the provident fund, a defined benefit plan. The employee and employer each make monthly contributions to the plan. A po/r_t.ligaion of the contribution is made to the provident fund trust managed by the Company or Government administered provident fund; while the balance contribution is made to the Government administered pension fund, a defined contribution plan. For the contribution made by the Company to the provident fund trust managed by the Company, the Company has an obligation to fund any sho/r_t.ligafall on the yield of the T rust\u2019s investments over the administered interest rates. The liability is actuarially determined (using the projected unit credit method) at the end of the year. The funds contributed to the T rust are invested in specific securities as mandated by law and generally consist of federal and state government bonds, debt instruments of government-owned corporations, equity and other eligible market securities. (ii) In respect of superannuation, a defined contribution plan for applicable employees, the Company contributes to the superannuation trust and the scheme is administered on its behalf by appointed fund managers and such contributions for each year of service rendered by the employees are charged to the statement of profit and loss. The Company has no fu/r_t.ligaher obligations to the superannuation plan beyond its contributions. (iii) Gratuity liability: The Company provide for gratuity, a defined benefit plan (the \u201cGratuity Plan\u201d) covering eligible employees. The Gratuity Plan provides a lump sum payment to vested employees at retirement, death, incapacitation or termination of employment, of an amount based on the respective employee\u2019s base salary and the tenure of employment (subject to a maximum of /uni20B920 lacs per employee). The liability is actuarially determined (using the projected unit credit method) at the end of each year. Actuarial gains/ losses are recognized immediately in the balance sheet with a corresponding debit or credit to other comprehensive income in the year in which they occur.

The Company measures share-based compensation cost at grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award and recognizes the cost on a straight line basis (net of estimated fo/r_f.ligaeitures) over the employee\u2019s requisite service period for an award with only service condition and for an award with both service and pe/r_f.ligaormance condition on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting po/r_t.ligaion of the award, as if award was in substance, multiple awards. On modification of an equity se/t_t.ligaled award, the Company re-estimates the fair value of stock option as on the date of modification and any incremental expense is expensed over the period from the modification date till the vesting date.",

The cost is recorded under the head employee benefit expense in the statement of profit and loss with corresponding increase in \u201cShare based payment reserve\u201d . The Company grants share-based awards to employees of its direct and indirect subsidiaries, requiring reimbursement for the actual cost of treasury shares upon exercise. Any excess cost over the fair value recovered from subsidiaries is treated as a reduction in investment. (s) Financial Instruments A financial instrument is a contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity. i. Financial assets All financial assets are recognized initially at fair value. T ransaction costs that are directly a/t_t.ligaributable to the acquisition of financial assets (other than financial assets at fair value through profit and loss) are added to the fair value measured on initial recognition of financial asset. Purchase and sale of financial assets are accounted for at trade date. However, trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component are measured at transaction price. Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash in banks and sho/r_t.liga-term deposits and investments with an original maturity of three months or less, which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents are considered net of outstanding bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and are considered pa/r_t.liga of the Company\u2019s cash management system. In the standalone balance sheet, bank overdrafts are presented under borrowings within current liabilities. Financial assets at amo/r_t.ligaized cost A financial asset is measured at the amo/r_t.ligaized cost if both the following conditions are met: (a) The asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets for collecting contractual cash flows and, (b) Contractual terms of the asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding. After initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amo/r_t.ligaized cost using the effective interest rate (EIR) method. Amo/r_t.ligaized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral pa/r_t.liga of the EIR. The EIR amo/r_t.ligaization is included in other income in the statement of profit and loss. The losses arising from impairment are recognized in the statement of profit and loss. This category includes cash and bank balances, loans, unbilled receivables, trade and other receivables. Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (OCI) A financial asset is classified and measured at fair value through OCI if both of the following criteria are met: (i) The objective of the business model is achieved both by collecting contractual cash flows and selling the financial assets, and (ii) The asset\u2019s contractual cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest. Financial asset included within the OCI category are measured initially as well as at each repo/r_t.ligaing date at fair value. Fair value movements are recognized in OCI. Interest income is recognized in statement of profit and loss for debt instruments. On derecognition of the asset, cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in OCI is reclassified from OCI to statement of profit and loss.",

Financial assets included at the fair value through profit and loss category are measured at fair value with all changes recognized in the statement of profit and loss. Equity investments Equity investments in subsidiaries are measured at cost less impairment if any. Derecognition of financial assets A financial asset is primarily derecognized when the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired, or the Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset. Impairment of financial assets The Company recognizes loss allowances using the expected credit loss (ECL) model for the financial assets which are not fair valued through profit and loss. Lifetime ECL allowance is recognized for trade receivables with no significant financing component. For all other financial assets, expected credit losses are measured at an amount equal to the 12-month ECL, unless there has been a significant increase in credit risk from initial recognition in which case they are measured at lifetime ECL. The amount of expected credit losses (or reversal) that is required to adjust the loss allowance at the repo/r_t.ligaing date is recognized in statement of profit and loss. ii. Financial liabilities All financial liabilities are recognized initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net of directly a/t_t.ligaributable transaction costs. The subsequent measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification, as described below: Financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss Financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit and loss are designated as such at the initial date of recognition, and only if the criteria in Ind AS 109 are satisfied. Changes in fair value of such liability are recognized in the statement of profit and loss. Financial liabilities at amo/r_t.ligaized cost The Company\u2019s financial liabilities at amo/r_t.ligaized cost, are initially recognized at net of transaction costs and includes trade payables, borrowings including bank overdrafts and other payables. After initial recognition, financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amo/r_t.ligaized cost using the effective interest rate (EIR) method except for deferred consideration recognized in a business combination which is subsequently measured at fair value through profit and loss. Gains and losses are recognized in the statement of profit and loss when the liabilities are derecognized as well as through the EIR amo/r_t.ligaization process. Amo/r_t.ligaized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral pa/r_t.liga of the EIR. The EIR amo/r_t.ligaization is included as finance costs in the statement of profit and loss. Derecognition A financial liability is derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. iii. Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting Foreign exchange forward contracts and options are purchased to mitigate the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates associated with forecast transactions denominated in ce/r_t.ligaain foreign currencies. The Company recognizes all derivatives as assets or liabilities measured at their fair value. Changes in fair value for derivatives not designated in a hedge accounting relationship are marked to market at each repo/r_t.ligaing date and the related gains (losses) are recognized in the statement of profit and loss as \u2018foreign exchange gains (losses)\u2019 .",

Changes in the fair value of derivatives (net of tax) that are designated as effective cash flow hedges are deferred and recorded in the hedging reserve account as a component of accumulated \u2018other comprehensive income (loss)\u2019 until the hedged transaction occurs and are then recognized in the statement of profit and loss. The ineffective po/r_t.ligaion of hedging derivatives is immediately recognized in other income (expenses) in the statement of profit and loss. In respect of derivatives designated as hedges, the Company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for unde/r_t.ligaaking various hedge transactions. The Company also formally assesses both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, whether each derivative is highly effective in offse/t_t.ligaing changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item. The Company determines the existence of an economic relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item based on the currency, amount and timing of their respective cash flows. Hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively from the last testing date when (1) it is determined that the derivative financial instrument is no longer effective in offse/t_t.ligaing changes in the fair value or cash flows of the underlying exposure being hedged; (2) the derivative financial instrument matures or is sold, terminated or exercised; or (3) it is determined that designating the derivative financial instrument as a hedge is no longer appropriate. When hedge accounting is discontinued the deferred gains or losses on the cash flow hedge remain in \u2018other comprehensive income (loss)\u2019 until the forecast transaction occurs. Any fu/r_t.ligaher change in the fair value of the derivative financial instrument is recognized in current year earnings. Offse/t_t.ligaing of financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is repo/r_t.ligaed in the balance sheet if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to se/t_t.ligale on a net basis to realize the assets and se/t_t.ligale the liabilities simultaneously. (t) Dividend Final dividend proposed by the Board of Directors is recognized upon approval by the shareholders who have the right to decrease but not increase the amount of dividend recommended by the Board of Directors. Interim dividends are recognized on declaration by the Board of Directors. Final and interim dividend excludes dividend on treasury shares. (u) Earnings per share (EPS) Basic EPS amounts are computed by dividing the net profit a/t_t.ligaributable to the equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year adjusted for treasury shares held. Diluted EPS amounts are computed by dividing the net profit a/t_t.ligaributable to the equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of equity shares considered for deriving basic earnings per share and also the weighted average number of equity shares that could have been issued upon conversion of all dilutive potential equity shares. The diluted potential equity shares are adjusted for the proceeds receivable had the shares been actually issued at fair value (i.e. the average market value of the outstanding shares). Pe/r_f.ligaormance based stock unit awards are included in dilutive potential shares when they become contingently issuable and have a dilutive impact and are excluded when they are not contingently issuable.",

Impairment is recognized, when the carrying amount of a CGU including the goodwill, exceeds the estimated recoverable amount of the CGU. The estimated value-in-use of the CGU is based on the future cash flow forecasts for 5 years and then on perpetuity on the basis of ce/r_t.ligaain assumptions which include revenue growth, earnings before interest and taxes, taxes, capital outflow and working capital requirement. The assumptions are taken on the basis of past trends and management estimates and judgement. Future cash flows are discounted with \u201cWeighted Average Cost of Capital\u201d . The key assumptions are as follows: As at 31 March 2025 IT and Business Services Engineering and R&D services HCLSoftware Revenue growth rate (average of next 5 years) (%) 6.8 5.1 1.0 T erminal revenue growth rate (%) 2.0 2.0 (4.8) Pre-tax discount rate (%) 13.2 14.1 17 .3 As at 31 March 2024 IT and Business Services Engineering and R&D services HCLSoftware Revenue growth rate (average of next 5 years) (%) 7.8 6.0 (0.6) T erminal revenue growth rate (%) 2.0 2.0 (4.1) Pre-tax discount rate (%) 12.6 13.8 16.2 As at 31 March 2025 and 31 March 2024, the estimated recoverable amount of each CGU exceeded the carrying amount and accordingly, no impairment was recognized.

The eligible units are eligible for a deduction of 100% of profits or gains derived from the expo/r_t.liga of services for the first five years from the year of commencement of operations and 50% of such profits and gains for the next five years. Ce/r_t.ligaain tax benefits are also available for a fu/r_t.ligaher period of five years subject to meeting reinvestment conditions.The aforesaid tax benefits will not be available to units having commenced the operations after 31 March 2021. The Company is subject to Minimum Alternate T ax (MAT) on its book profits if normal tax liability is lower than MAT, which gives rise to future economic benefits in the form of adjustment of future income tax liability. MAT paid for a year can be set-off against the normal tax liability within fifteen subsequent years, expiring between the years 2025 to 2039. Corporate taxpayers can opt for a specified lower tax rate in lieu of current applicable tax rate subject to taxpayers not claiming any specified tax incentives including tax incentives available to special economic zone units and carryover of unutilized MAT credit (\u2018new tax regime\u2019). The Company will opt for new tax regime in the year new tax regime is beneficial to the Company. The tax returns are subject to examination by the tax authorities in the jurisdictions where the Company conducts business. Regular tax examination is open for India, for tax years beginning 1 April, 2022 and ce/r_t.ligaain ma/t_t.ligaers relating to prior years for which the tax assessment has already got concluded are subject to ongoing litigations, appeals and reassessment proceedings. The Company has significant inter-company transactions with its subsidiaries and has also filed for bilateral advance pricing agreements in ce/r_t.ligaain jurisdictions sta/r_t.ligaing from 1 April 2017 for some of which the resolutions have been reached during the year and accounted for in the financial statements. For ce/r_t.ligaain jurisdictions, the resolution is yet to be reached. Resolution of these ma/t_t.ligaers involves some degree of unce/r_t.ligaainty; accordingly, the Company recognizes income tax liability that it believes will ultimately result from the proceedings.",

The company determines hedge ratio based on prevailing market conditions, availability and liquidity of hedging instruments, and hedge ineffectiveness. The counterpa/r_t.ligay in these derivative instruments are banks and the Company considers the risks of non-pe/r_f.ligaormance by the counterpa/r_t.ligay as insignificant. The Company has entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts and options that are designated as cash flow hedges and the related forecasted transactions extend through March 2030. The Company does not use these derivative instruments for speculative purposes.",

Market risk Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Market risk comprises of currency risk and interest rate risk. The Company is primarily exposed to fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates. (i) Foreign currency risk Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of an exposure will fluctuate because of changes in exchange rates. The Company\u2019s exposure to the risk of changes in exchange rates relates primarily to the Company\u2019s operations and the Company\u2019s net investments in foreign branches. The exchange rate risk primarily arises from assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the respective branches and foreign currency forecasted revenue and cash flows. A significant po/r_t.ligaion of the Company revenue is in US Dollar, Pound Sterling (GBP) and Euro while a large po/r_t.ligaion of costs are in Indian rupees. The fluctuation in exchange rates in respect to India rupee may have potential impact on the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income and equity. T o mitigate the foreign currency risk, the Company uses derivatives as governed by the Company\u2019s strategy, which provides principles on the use of such forward contracts and currency options consistent with the Company\u2019s Risk Management Policy. Appreciation/depreciation of 5% in respective foreign currencies with respect to functional currency of the Company & its branches would result in increase/decrease in the Company\u2019s profit before tax by approximately /uni20B9537 crores (31 March 2024, /uni20B9575 crores) for the year ended 31 March 2025. The rate sensitivity is calculated by aggregation of the net foreign exchange rate exposure and a simultaneous parallel foreign exchange rates shift of all the currencies by 5% against the respective functional currencies of the Company and its branches. The sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual change. Non-derivative foreign currency exposure in major currencies is as below: Financial assets Financial liabilities 31 March 2025 31 March 2024 31 March 2025 31 March 2024 USD/INR 11,407 7 ,215 2,227 891 GBP/INR 516 664 65 61 EUR/INR 926 1,268 251 146 (ii) Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Company\u2019s investments are primarily in fixed rate interest bearing investments. Hence the Company is not significantly exposed to interest rate risk. Credit risk Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist principally of cash and bank balances, inter-corporate deposits, trade receivables, finance lease receivables, investment securities and derivative instruments. The cash resources of the Company are invested with mutual funds, banks, financial institutions and corporations after an evaluation of the credit risk. By their nature, all such financial instruments involve risks, including the credit risk of non-pe/r_f.ligaormance by counterpa/r_t.ligaies. The customers of the Company are primarily corporations based in the United States of America and Europe and accordingly, trade receivables, unbilled receivables and finance lease receivables are concentrated in the respective countries.

The effective date from which the changes are applicable is yet to be notified and the final rules are yet to be notified. The Company will carry out an evaluation of the impact and record the same in the financial statements in the period in which the Code becomes effective and the related rules are notified.

In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid consolidated financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (\u201cAct\u201d) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the consolidated state of affairs of the Group as at 31 March 2025, of its consolidated profit and other comprehensive income, consolidated changes in equity and consolidated cash flows for the year then ended. Basis for Opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under Section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those SAs are fu/r_t.ligaher described in the Auditor\u2019s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our repo/r_t.liga. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements in terms of the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Cha/r_t.ligaered Accountants of India and the relevant provisions of the Act, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the consolidated financial statements. Key Audit Ma/t_t.ligaer Key audit ma/t_t.ligaers are those ma/t_t.ligaers that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These ma/t_t.ligaers were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these ma/t_t.ligaers. Evaluation of tax positions and litigations See Note 1(i) and 3.25 to consolidated financial statements The key audit ma/t_t.ligaer How the ma/t_t.ligaer was addressed in our audit The Group operates in multiple global jurisdictions which requires it to estimate its income tax liabilities according to the tax laws of the respective tax jurisdictions. Fu/r_t.ligaher, there are ma/t_t.ligaers of interpretation in terms of application of tax laws and related rules to determine current tax provision and deferred taxes. The Group has material tax positions and litigations on a range of tax ma/t_t.ligaers primarily in India. This requires management to make significant judgments to determine the possible outcome of unce/r_t.ligaain tax positions and litigations and their consequent impact on related accounting and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. In view of the significance of the ma/t_t.ligaer we applied the following audit procedures in this area, among others to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence: \u25cf testing the design, implementation and operating effectiveness of the Group\u2019s key controls over identifying unce/r_t.ligaain tax positions and ma/t_t.ligaers involving litigations.",

Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with Reference to Financial Statements Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Our audit involves pe/r_f.ligaorming procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor\u2019s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements.

The Company was incorporated under the provisions of the Companies Act applicable in India in November 1991, having its registered office at 806, Siddha/r_t.ligah, 96, Nehru Place, New Delhi - 110019. The Group leverages its global technology workforce and intellectual prope/r_t.ligaies to deliver solutions across following ve/r_t.ligaicals - Financial Services, Manufacturing, Life Sciences & Healthcare, Public Services, Retail & CPG, T echnology & Services and T elecom, Media, Publishing and Ente/r_t.ligaainment. The consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2025 were approved and authorized for issue by the Board of Directors on 22 April 2025. 1. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (a) Basis of preparation These consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) prescribed under section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules as amended from time to time and presentation requirements of Schedule III (Division II) to the Companies Act, 2013, as applicable to the consolidated financial statements. These consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention on an accrual and going concern basis, except for the following assets and liabilities which have been measured at fair value: (a) Derivative financial instruments, (b) Ce/r_t.ligaain financial assets and liabilities (refer accounting policy regarding financial instruments), (c) Defined benefit plans The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are consistent with those of the previous year except where a newly issued accounting standard is initially adopted or a revision to an existing accounting standard requires a change in the accounting policy. All assets and liabilities have been classified as current and non-current as per the Group\u2019s normal operating cycle of 12 months. The statement of cash flows has been prepared under indirect method. The Group uses the Indian rupee (\u2018/uni20B9\u2019) as its repo/r_t.ligaing currency. All amounts are presented in crores of /uni20B9rounded to whole number and amounts less than /uni20B90.50 crores are presented as \u201c-\u201d . (b) Basis of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of HCL T echnologies Limited, the Parent Company, and its subsidiaries. Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control of the subsidiary. The Group controls an investee if and only if the Group has: (a) Power over the investee (i.e., existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee), (b) Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee, and (c) The ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns. Generally, there is a presumption that a majority of voting rights result in control.",

    "content": "336Consolidated Financial Statements Notes to consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2025 (All amounts in crores of /uni20B9, except share data and as stated otherwise) The financial statements of the subsidiaries in the Group are added on a line-by-line basis and inter-company balances and transactions including unrealized gain/loss from such transactions, are eliminated upon consolidation. When the Group ceases control over a subsidiary, it derecognizes the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, and any related non-controlling interest and other components of equity. Any resulting gain or loss is recognized in consolidated statement of profit and loss. Any interest retained in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value when control is ceased. The consolidated financial statements are prepared by applying uniform accounting policies in use by the Group. An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence, but not control or joint control over financial and operating policies. Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, after initially being recognized at cost. The aggregate of the Group\u2019s share of profit and loss of an associate is shown on the face of the consolidated statement of profit and loss. (c) Use of estimates, judgements and assumptions The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with Ind AS requires the management to make estimates and judgements that affect the repo/r_t.ligaed amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and other comprehensive income (OCI) that are repo/r_t.ligaed and disclosed in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates are based on the management\u2019s best knowledge of current events, historical experience, actions that the Group may unde/r_t.ligaake in the future and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Changes in estimates are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the year in which the changes are made. Significant estimates, judgements and assumptions are used for, but not limited to. (i.) Accounting for costs expected to be incurred to complete pe/r_f.ligaormance under fixed price projects and determination of stand-alone selling prices for each distinct pe/r_f.ligaormance obligation in contracts involving multiple pe/r_f.ligaormance obligations, refer note 1(g). (ii.) Allowance for uncollectible trade receivables, refer note 1(t)(i). (iii.) Fair value of the consideration transferred (including contingent consideration) and fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, measured on a provisional basis in case of business combination, refer note 1(d). (iv.) Recognition of income and deferred taxes, refer note 1(i) and note 3.25. (v.) Key actuarial assumptions for measurement of future obligations under employee benefit plans, refer note 1(r) and note 3.31. (vi.) Estimated fo/r_f.ligaeitures in share-based compensation expense, refer note 1(s). (vii.) Useful lives of prope/r_t.ligay, plant and equipment, refer note 1(j). (viii.) Lives of intangible assets, refer note 1(k). (ix.) Identification of leases and measurement of lease liabilities and right of use assets, refer note 1(n). (x.) Key assumptions used for impairment of goodwill, refer note 1(p) and note 3.2. (xi.) Provisions and contingent liabilities, refer note 1(q) and note 3.34. (d) Business combinations and goodwill Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is the aggregate of the consideration transferred measured at fair value at the acquisition date and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree. For each business combination, the Group measures the non-controlling interest in the acquiree at fair value. Acquisition related costs are expensed as incurred. Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer is recognized at fair value at the acquisition date.",

For each entity, the Group determines the functional currency, and items included in the financial statements of each entity are measured using that functional currency. The Group uses the direct method of consolidation and on disposal of a foreign operation the gain or loss that is reclassified to the statement of profit and loss reflects the amount that arises from using this method. T ransactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded by the Group\u2019s entities at their respective functional currency spot rates at the date of the transaction. Foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities are translated to the relevant functional currency at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences arising on se/t_t.ligalement or translation of monetary items are recognized in the statement of profit and loss. Non-monetary assets and non-monetary liabilities denominated in a foreign currency and measured at historical cost are translated at the exchange rate prevalent at the date of initial transaction. Non-monetary assets and non-monetary liabilities denominated in a foreign currency and measured at fair value are translated at the exchange rate prevalent at the date when the fair value was determined. T ransaction gains or losses realized upon se/t_t.ligalement of foreign currency transactions are included in determining net profit for the year. Revenue, expenses and cash-flow items denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the relevant functional currencies using the exchange rate in effect on the date of the transaction. The translation of foreign operations from respective functional currency into INR (the repo/r_t.ligaing currency) for assets and liabilities is pe/r_f.ligaormed using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, and for revenue, expenses and cash flows is pe/r_f.ligaormed using an appropriate daily weighted average exchange rate for the respective years. The exchange differences arising on translation for consolidation are repo/r_t.ligaed as a component of \u2018other comprehensive income (loss)\u2019 . On disposal of a foreign operation, the component of OCI relating to that pa/r_t.ligaicular foreign operation is recognized in the statement of profit and loss. (f) Fair value measurement The Group records ce/r_t.ligaain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis. The Group determines fair values based on the price it would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market pa/r_t.ligaicipants at the measurement date in the principal or most advantageous market for that asset or liability. The Group holds ce/r_t.ligaain fixed income securities, equity securities and derivatives, which must be measured using the guidance for fair value hierarchy and related valuation methodologies. The guidance specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to each measurement are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Group\u2019s assumptions about current market conditions. The fair value hierarchy also requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The prescribed fair value hierarchy and related valuation methodologies are as follows: Level 1 - Quoted inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.",

These assets consist primarily of non- financial assets such as goodwill and intangible assets. Goodwill and intangible assets recognized in business combinations are measured at fair value initially and subsequently when there is an indicator of impairment, the impairment is recognized. A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market pa/r_t.ligaicipant\u2019s ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market pa/r_t.ligaicipant who would use the asset in its highest and best use. (g) Revenue recognition Revenue is recognized when, or as, control of a promised service or good transfers to a customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration (T ransaction price) to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring those products or services (Pe/r_f.ligaormance obligation). Revenue is recognized for any contract, once it is approved in writing, is legally enforceable, the rights of the pa/r_t.ligaies are identified, payment terms are defined, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. Revenue is measured based on the T ransaction price which is the consideration of the contract and is shown net of applicable taxes and adjusted for any variable consideration like volume discounts, service level allowances, incentive or any other discount. T ransaction price is also adjusted for the effects of the time value of money if the contract includes a significant financing component. Revenue from time-and-material, volume based, and transaction-based contracts is recognized as the related services are pe/r_f.ligaormed through effo/r_t.ligas expended, units serviced, number of transactions processed, etc. that correspond with value transferred to customer. Revenue related to fixed price contracts where pe/r_f.ligaormance obligations and control are satisfied over a period of time like technology integration contracts, complex network building contracts, system implementations and application development contracts is recognized based on progress towards completion of the pe/r_f.ligaormance obligation using percentage-of-completion method. Revenue is recognized based on the costs incurred to date as a percentage of the total estimated costs to fulfill the contract. Any revision in cost to complete would result in an increase or decrease in revenue and such changes are recorded in the period in which they are identified. In arrangements involving sharing of customer revenues for services delivered, revenue is recognized when the right to receive such revenue share is established. Revenue related to other fixed price contracts providing maintenance and suppo/r_t.liga services, are recognized based on the right to invoice for services pe/r_f.ligaormed for contracts in which the invoicing is representative of the value being delivered. If invoicing is not consistent with value delivered, revenues are recognized basis stand-alone selling price for the service pe/r_f.ligaormed. The Group uses cost plus expected margin to determine stand-alone selling price. Revenue from distinct proprietary software is recognized at a point in time at the inception of the arrangement when right to use is granted to the customer. In the case of renewals of term licenses with existing customers, revenue from term license is recognized at a point in time when the renewal is agreed on signing of contracts. Revenue from suppo/r_t.liga and subscription (S&S) is recognized over the contract term on a straight-line basis as the Group is providing a service of standing ready to provide suppo/r_t.liga, when-and-if needed, and is providing unspecified software upgrades on a when-and-if available basis over the contract term.",

In case software are bundled with suppo/r_t.liga and subscription either for perpetual or term based license, such suppo/r_t.liga and subscription contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net fees paid by the customer to purchase the license and are generally recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual period that the suppo/r_t.liga services are provided. When a sales arrangement contains provision of multiple products, services and software licenses, the Group identifies the distinct pe/r_f.ligaormance obligation including lease obligation and allocates total consideration to each pe/r_f.ligaormance obligation on a relative standalone selling price. Group uses cost plus expected margin to determine standalone selling price. Revenue from finance leases is recognized when all risks and ownership are transferred to the customer, with no remaining obligations that affect acceptance. Revenue is recognized at the fair value of the asset or, if lower, the present value of lease payments, discounted at a market interest rate.

Revenue from ce/r_t.ligaain activities in transition services in outsourcing arrangements are not capable of being distinct or represent separate pe/r_f.ligaormance obligation and is recognized over the period of the arrangement. Direct and incremental costs in relation to such transition activities which are expected to be recoverable under the contract are considered as contract fulfillment costs and classified as Deferred contract cost and recognized over the period of arrangement. Ce/r_t.ligaain upfront non-recurring incremental contract acquisition costs and other upfront fee paid to customer are deferred and classified as Deferred contract cost and amo/r_t.ligaized to revenue, usually on a straight-line basis, over the term of the contract. An onerous contract provision is recognized when the expected unavoidable costs of meeting the future obligations exceed the expected economic benefits to be received under a contract. Such provision, if any, is recorded in the period in which such losses become probable and is included in the cost of revenues. Contract assets are recognized when revenue recognized is more than billing and right to consideration is conditional upon factors other than the passage of time. Unbilled receivables are recognized where the right to consideration is unconditional and only the passage of time is required before the payment is due (i.e., only act of invoicing is pending). Contract liability is Group\u2019s obligation to transfer goods or services to customers when there is excess billing over the revenue recognized. (h) Other income Other income mainly comprises interest income on debt securities, bank and other deposits, other interest income recognized using the effective interest method, profit on sale of prope/r_t.ligay, plant and equipments, debt securities and mutual fund and net foreign exchange gains. (i) Income taxes Income tax expense comprises current and deferred income tax. Income tax expense is recognized in the statement of profit and loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognized directly in equity, in which case it is recognized in equity. Current income tax for current and prior periods is recognized at the amount expected to be paid to or recovered from the tax authorities, using the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Provision for income tax includes the impact of provisions established for unce/r_t.ligaain income tax positions. T ax assets and liabilities are offset only if there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognized amounts, and it is intended to realize the asset and se/t_t.ligale the liability on a net basis or simultaneously. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities recognized for all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for those temporary differences which originate during the tax holiday period and are reversed after the tax holiday period. For this purpose, reversal of timing differences is determined using first-in- first-out method. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each repo/r_t.ligaing date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realized.",

The adjustment is either treated as a reduction in goodwill (as long as it does not exceed goodwill) if it was incurred during the measurement period or recognized in the statement of profit and loss. In some tax jurisdictions, the amount of tax deductions on share based payments to employees are different from the related cumulative remuneration expenses. If the amount of the tax deduction (or estimated future tax deduction) exceeds the amount of the related cumulative remuneration expense, such excess amount of tax deduction and the associated tax benefit is recognized directly in retained earnings. (j) Prope/r_t.ligay, plant and equipment Prope/r_t.ligay, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if any. Cost comprises the purchase price and directly a/t_t.ligaributable cost of bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use. Any trade discounts and rebates are deducted in arriving at the purchase price. The Group identifies and determines separate useful lives for each major component of the prope/r_t.ligay, plant and equipment, if they have a useful life that is materially different from that of the asset as a whole. Expenses on existing prope/r_t.ligay, plant and equipment, including day-to-day repairs, maintenance expenditure and cost of replacing pa/r_t.ligas, are charged to the statement of profit and loss for the year during which such expenses are incurred. Gains or losses arising from derecognition of assets are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognized in the statement of profit and loss when the asset is derecognized. Prope/r_t.ligay, plant and equipment under construction and cost of assets not ready for use at the year-end are disclosed as capital work - in- progress. Depreciation on prope/r_t.ligay, plant and equipment is provided on the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, as determined by the management. Depreciation is charged on a pro-rata basis for assets purchased/ sold during the year. The management\u2019s estimates of the useful lives of various assets for computing depreciation are as follows: Asset description Asset life (in years) Buildings 20 Plant and equipment (including air conditioners, electrical installations) 10 Office equipment 5 Computers and networking equipment 4-5 Furniture and fixtures 7 Vehicles 5 The useful lives as given above best represent the period over which the management expects to use these assets, based on technical assessment. The estimated useful lives for these assets are therefore different from the useful lives prescribed under Pa/r_t.liga C of Schedule II of the Companies Act 2013. The residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of prope/r_t.ligay, plant and equipment are reviewed at each financial year-end and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate. (k) Intangible assets Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is measured at their fair value at the date of acquisition. Subsequently, following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amo/r_t.ligaization and impairment losses.

Amo/r_t.ligaization of the asset begins when development is complete and the asset is available for use. It is amo/r_t.ligaized over the period of expected future benefit. Amo/r_t.ligaization expense is recognized in the statement of profit and loss. During the period of development, the asset is tested for impairment annually. (m) Borrowing costs Borrowing costs directly a/t_t.ligaributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use are capitalized as pa/r_t.liga of the cost of the asset.

(n) Leases A lease is a contract that contains right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Group as a lessee Group is lessee in case of leasehold land, office space, accommodation for its employees & IT equipment. These leases are evaluated to determine whether it contains lease based on principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both lessees and lessors as defined in Ind AS 116. Right-of-use asset represents the Group\u2019s right to control the underlying assets under lease and the lease liability is the obligation to make the lease payments related to the underlying asset under lease.

Right-of - use asset is depreciated based on straight line method over the lease term or useful life of right-of-use asset, whichever is less. Subsequently, right-of-use asset is measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation, accumulated impairment losses, if any and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liability. The lease liability is measured at the lease commencement date and determined using the present value of the minimum lease payments not yet paid and the Group\u2019s incremental borrowing rate, which approximates the rate at which the Group would borrow, in the country where the lease was executed. The Group has used a single discount rate for a po/r_t.ligafolio of leases with reasonably similar characteristics. The lease payment comprises fixed payment less any lease incentives, variable lease payment that depends on an index or a rate, exercise price of a purchase option if the Group is reasonably ce/r_t.ligaain to exercise the option and payment of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising an option to terminate the lease. Lease liability is subsequently measured by increase the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability, reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payment made and remeasuring the carrying amount to reflect any reassessment or modification, if any. The Group has elected to not recognize leases with a lease term of 12 months or less in the consolidated balance sheet, including those acquired in a business combination, and lease costs for those sho/r_t.liga-term leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term in the consolidated statement of profit and loss. For all asset classes, the Group has elected the lessee practical expedient to combine lease and non-lease components and account for the combined unit as a single lease component in case there is no separate payment defined under the contract. Group as a lessor Leases in which the Group does not transfer substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognized over the lease term on the same basis as rental income. Contingent rents are recognized as revenue in the year in which they are earned or contingency is resolved. Leases in which the Group transfers substantially all the risk and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as finance leases. Assets given under finance lease are recognized as a receivables at an amount equal to the present value of lease receivables. After initial recognition, the Group appo/r_t.ligaions lease rentals between the principal repayment and interest income so as to achieve a constant periodic rate of return on the net investment outstanding in respect of the finance leases. The interest income is recognized in the consolidated statement of profit and loss. Initial direct costs such as legal cost, brokerage cost etc. are recognized immediately in the statement of profit and loss. When arrangements include multiple pe/r_f.ligaormance obligations, the Group allocates the consideration in the contract between the lease components and the non-lease components on a relative standalone selling price basis.

(p) Impairment of non-financial assets Goodwill Goodwill is tested annually on March 31, for impairment, or sooner whenever there is an indication that goodwill may be impaired, relying on a number of factors including operating results, business plans and future cash flows. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the Group\u2019s cash generating units (CGU) expected to benefit from the synergies arising from the business combination.

The recoverable amount of a CGU is the higher of its fair value less cost to sell and its value-in-use. Value-in-use is the present value of future cash flows expected to be derived from the CGU. T otal impairment loss of a CGU is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to the CGU and then to the other assets of the CGU, pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the CGU. An impairment loss on goodwill recognized in the statement of profit and loss is not reversed in the subsequent period. Intangible assets and prope/r_t.ligay, plant and equipment Intangible assets and prope/r_t.ligay, plant and equipment are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in- use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the CGU to which the asset belongs. Impairment, if any, is measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated recoverable amount of the asset. Subsequently if there is a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount, the impairment loss is reversed. Such reversal is made only to the extent that the asset\u2019s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined on the date of reversal, if no impairment loss had been recognized. Such impairment and any subsequent reversal is recognized in the statement of profit and loss. (q) Provisions and contingent liabilities A provision is recognized if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to se/t_t.ligale the obligation. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows. The Group uses significant judgement to disclose contingent liabilities. Contingent liabilities are disclosed when there is a possible obligation arising from past events, the existence of which will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more unce/r_t.ligaain future events not wholly within the control of the Group or a present obligation that arises from past events where it is either not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to se/t_t.ligale the obligation or a reliable estimate of the amount cannot be made. Contingent assets are neither recognized nor disclosed in the financial statements.

The employees can carry forward up to the specified po/r_t.ligaion of the unutilized accumulated compensated absences and utilize it in future periods or receive cash at retirement or termination of employment.

Amo/r_t.ligaized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral pa/r_t.liga of the EIR. The EIR amo/r_t.ligaization is included in other income in the statement of profit and loss. The losses arising from impairment are recognized in the statement of profit and loss. This category includes cash and bank balances, loans, unbilled receivables, trade and other receivables. Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (OCI) A financial asset is classified and measured at fair value through OCI if both of the following criteria are met: (i) The objective of the business model is achieved both by collecting contractual cash flows and selling the financial assets, and (ii) The asset\u2019s contractual cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest. Financial asset included within the OCI category are measured initially as well as at each repo/r_t.ligaing date at fair value. Fair value movements are recognized in OCI. Interest income is recognized in statement of profit and loss for debt instruments. On derecognition of the asset, cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in OCI is reclassified from OCI to statement of profit and loss. Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss Any financial asset, which does not meet the criteria for categorization at amo/r_t.ligaized cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income, is classified at fair value through profit and loss. Financial assets included at the fair value through profit and loss category are measured at fair value with all changes recognized in the statement of profit and loss. Equity investments All equity instruments are initially measured at fair value and are subsequently re-measured with all changes recognized in the statement of profit and loss. In limited circumstances, investments, for which sufficient, more recent information to measure fair value is not available cost represents the best estimate of fair value within that range. Derecognition of financial assets A financial asset is primarily derecognized when the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired, or the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset. Impairment of financial assets The Group recognizes loss allowances using the expected credit loss (ECL) model for the financial assets which are not fair valued through profit and loss. Lifetime ECL allowance is recognized for trade receivables with no significant financing component.",

Financial liabilities All financial liabilities are recognized initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net of directly a/t_t.ligaributable transaction costs. The subsequent measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification, as described below: Financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss Financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit and loss are designated as such at the initial date of recognition, and only if the criteria in Ind AS 109 are satisfied. Changes in fair value of such liability are recognized in the statement of profit and loss. Financial liabilities at amo/r_t.ligaized cost The Group\u2019s financial liabilities at amo/r_t.ligaized cost, are initially recognized at net of transaction costs and includes trade payables, borrowings including bank overdrafts and other payables. After initial recognition, financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amo/r_t.ligaized cost using the effective interest rate (EIR) method except for deferred consideration recognized in a business combination which is subsequently measured at fair value through profit and loss. Gains and losses are recognized in the statement of profit and loss when the liabilities are derecognized as well as through the EIR amo/r_t.ligaization process. Amo/r_t.ligaized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral pa/r_t.liga of the EIR. The EIR amo/r_t.ligaization is included as finance costs in the statement of profit and loss. Derecognition A financial liability is derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. iii. Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting Foreign exchange forward contracts and options are purchased to mitigate the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates associated with forecast transactions denominated in ce/r_t.ligaain foreign currencies. The Group recognizes all derivatives as assets or liabilities measured at their fair value. Changes in fair value for derivatives not designated in a hedge accounting relationship are marked to market at each repo/r_t.ligaing date and the related gains (losses) are recognized in the statement of profit and loss as \u2018foreign exchange gains (losses)\u2019 . The foreign exchange forward contracts and options in respect of forecasted transactions which meet the hedging criteria are designated as cash flow hedges. Changes in the fair value of derivatives (net of tax) that are designated as effective cash flow hedges are deferred and recorded in the hedging reserve account as a component of accumulated \u2018other comprehensive income (loss)\u2019 until the hedged transaction occurs and are then recognized in the statement of profit and loss. The ineffective po/r_t.ligaion of hedging derivatives is immediately recognized in other income (expenses) in the statement of profit and loss. In respect of derivatives designated as hedges, the Group formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for unde/r_t.ligaaking various hedge transactions. The Group also formally assesses both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, whether each derivative is highly effective in offse/t_t.ligaing changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item. The Group determines the existence of an economic relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item based on the currency, amount and timing of their respective cash flows.",

When hedge accounting is discontinued the deferred gains or losses on the cash flow hedge remain in \u2018other comprehensive income (loss)\u2019 until the forecast transaction occurs. Any fu/r_t.ligaher change in the fair value of the derivative financial instrument is recognized in current year earnings. Offse/t_t.ligaing of financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is repo/r_t.ligaed in the consolidated balance sheet if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to se/t_t.ligale on a net basis to realize the assets and se/t_t.ligale the liabilities simultaneously. (u) Dividend Final dividend proposed by the Board of Directors is recognized upon approval by the shareholders who have the right to decrease but not increase the amount of dividend recommended by the Board of Directors. Interim dividends are recognized on declaration by the Board of Directors. Final and interim dividend excludes dividend on treasury shares. (v) Earnings per share (EPS) Basic EPS amounts are computed by dividing the net profit a/t_t.ligaributable to the equity holders of the Parent Company by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year adjusted for treasury shares held. Diluted EPS amounts are computed by dividing the net profit a/t_t.ligaributable to the equity holders of the Parent Company by the weighted average number of equity shares considered for deriving basic earnings per share and also the weighted average number of equity shares that could have been issued upon conversion of all dilutive potential equity shares. The diluted potential equity shares are adjusted for the proceeds receivable had the shares been actually issued at fair value (i.e. the average market value of the outstanding shares). Pe/r_f.ligaormance based stock unit awards are included in dilutive potential shares when they become contingently issuable and have a dilutive impact and are excluded when they are not contingently issuable. Dilutive potential equity shares are deemed conve/r_t.ligaed as at the beginning of the year, unless issued at a later date. Dilutive potential equity shares are determined independently for each year presented. The number of shares and potentially dilutive equity shares are adjusted retrospectively for all periods presented for bonus shares. (w) Nature and purpose of reserves Remeasurement of defined benefit plans The Group recognizes actuarial gains/losses on defined benefit plans in the balance sheet with a corresponding debit or credit to other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Treasury share reserve The Company\u2019s equity shares held by a trust, which is consolidated as a pa/r_t.liga of the Group, are classified as T reasury shares. T reasury shares are carried at acquisition cost and presented as a deduction from total equity as \u201cT reasury share reserve\u201d . As and when treasury shares are transferred to employees on exercise after satisfaction of the vesting conditions, the balance lying in \u201cT reasury share reserve\u201d is transferred to \u201cRetained earnings\u201d . Securities premium Securities premium is used to record the premium on issue of shares. The reserve can be utilized only for limited purposes such as issuance of bonus shares and buyback of shares in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 in India.

Impairment is recognized, when the carrying amount of a CGU including the goodwill, exceeds the estimated recoverable amount of the CGU. The estimated value-in-use of the CGU is based on the future cash flow forecasts for 5 years and then on perpetuity on the basis of ce/r_t.ligaain assumptions which include revenue growth, earnings before interest and taxes, taxes, capital outflow and working capital requirement. The assumptions are taken on the basis of past trends and management estimates and judgement. Future cash flows are discounted with \u201cWeighted Average Cost of Capital\u201d . The key assumptions are as follows: As at 31 March 2025 IT and Business Services Engineering and R&D services HCL Software Revenue growth rate (average of next 5 years) (%) 6.8 5.1 1.0 T erminal revenue growth rate (%) 2.0 2.0 (4.8) Pre-tax discount rate (%) 13.2 14.1 17 .3 As at 31 March 2024 IT and Business Services Engineering and R&D services HCL Software Revenue growth rate (average of next 5 years) (%) 7.8 6.0 (0.6) T erminal revenue growth rate (%) 2.0 2.0 (4.1) Pre-tax discount rate (%) 12.6 13.8 16.2 As at 31 March 2025 and 31 March 2024, the estimated recoverable amount of each CGU exceeded the carrying amount and accordingly, no impairment was recognized. An analysis of the sensitivity of the computation to a change in key assumptions based on reasonable probability did not identify any probable scenario in which the recoverable amount of the CGUs would decrease below the carrying amount. 3.3 Other intangible assets The changes in the carrying value for the year ended 31 March 2025 Software T echnology (including Licensed IPRs) Customer- related intangibles Others T otal Gross block as at 1 April 2024 1,098 8,881 8,179 301 18,459 Additions 79 6 375 - 460 Acquired through business combinations - 766 414 5 1,185 Disposals/other adjustments (3) - (32) (7) (42) T ranslation exchange differences 24 35 51 5 115 Gross block as at 31 March 2025 1,198 9,688 8,987 304 20,177 Accumulated amo/r_t.ligaization and impairment as at 1 April 2024 1,002 5,403 4,808 116 11,329 Amo/r_t.ligaization 94 889 891 62 1,936 Disposals/other adjustments (3) - (32) (7) (42) T ranslation exchange differences 1 28 25 1 55 Accumulated amo/r_t.ligaization and impairment as at 31 March 2025 1,094 6,320 5,692 172 13,278 Net block as at 31 March 2025 104 3,368 3,295 132 6,899 Estimated remaining useful life (in years) 3 1-10 1-9 1-3",

The eligible units are eligible for a deduction of 100% of profits or gains derived from the expo/r_t.liga of services for the first five years from the year of commencement of operations and 50% of such profits and gains for the next five years. Ce/r_t.ligaain tax benefits are also available for a fu/r_t.ligaher period of five years subject to meeting reinvestment conditions. The aforesaid tax benefits will not be available to units having commenced the operations after 31 March 2021. The Company and its subsidiaries in India are subject to Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) on its book profits if normal tax liability is lower than MAT, which gives rise to future economic benefits in the form of adjustment of future income tax liability. MAT paid for a year can be set-off against the normal tax liability within fifteen subsequent years, expiring between the years 2025 to 2039. In India, Corporate taxpayers can opt for a specified lower tax rate in lieu of current applicable tax rate subject to taxpayers not claiming any specified tax incentives including tax incentives available to special economic zone units and carryover of unutilized MAT credit (\u2018new tax regime\u2019). The Company will opt for new tax regime in the year new tax regime is beneficial to the Company. The tax returns are subject to examination by the tax authorities in the jurisdictions where the Group conducts business. The Group\u2019s two major tax jurisdictions are India and USA. T ax examination is open in USA for tax years beginning 1 April 2017 onwards and for India, regular tax examination is open for tax years beginning 1 April 2022 and ce/r_t.ligaain ma/t_t.ligaers relating to prior years for which the tax assessment has already got concluded are subject to ongoing litigations, appeals and reassessment proceedings. The Company has significant inter-company transactions with its subsidiaries including in USA and UK. The Company has also filed for bilateral advance pricing agreements in ce/r_t.ligaain jurisdictions sta/r_t.ligaing from 1 April 2017 for some of which the resolutions have been reached during the year and accounted for in the consolidated financial statements. For ce/r_t.ligaain jurisdictions, the resolution is yet to be reached. Resolution of these ma/t_t.ligaers involves some degree of unce/r_t.ligaainty; accordingly, the Group recognizes income tax liability that it believes will ultimately result from the proceedings.",

Deferred tax assets primarily related to carried forward losses and other temporary differences for ce/r_t.ligaain subsidiaries amounting to /uni20B979 crores (31 March 2024, /uni20B996 crores) was not recognized as per applicable accounting standards. These tax losses can be carried forward for an indefinite period except for tax losses amounting to /uni20B938 crores (31 March 2024, /uni20B942 crores) which will expire by 31 March 2033 (previous year, 31 March 2032). Above tables represent the gross deferred tax assets and liabilities. Amounts of deferred tax assets and liabilities presented in consolidated balance sheet have been offset, wherever the Group has legally enforceable right and it is related to same taxable authority. Undistributed earnings of the subsidiaries aggregate approximately /uni20B927 ,382 crores (31 March 2024, /uni20B925,185 crores). The Group has the intent to reinvest the undistributed foreign earnings indefinitely in its significant overseas operations or repatriate only to the extent these can be distributed in a tax free manner. Consequently, the Company did not record a deferred tax liability on the undistributed earnings except for ce/r_t.ligaain subsidiaries where the undistributed earnings are estimated to be in excess of the expected reinvestment needs. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has published the model rules for global minimum tax (Pillar Two model rules). Pillar Two legislation has been enacted, or substantively enacted, in ce/r_t.ligaain jurisdictions where the Group operates. The Group is within the scope of the OECD Pillar Two model rules and has evaluated the potential exposure to global minimum tax. The Group does not expect any material financial impact for the current period. The evaluation of the potential exposure is based on the most recent country-by-country repo/r_t.ligaing, and financial statements for the constituent entities in the Group. 3.26 Components of other comprehensive income a/t_t.ligaributable to owners of the Company Y ear ended 31 March 2025 31 March 2024 A Items that will not be reclassified to statement of profit and loss Remeasurement of defined benefit plans Opening balance (net of tax) 207 183 Actuarial gains (losses) (1) 32 Income tax benefit (expense) 20 (8) Divestment in subsidiaries (2) - Closing balance (net of tax) 224 207",

Valuation Methodologies Investments: The Group\u2019s investments consist of investment in debt linked mutual funds which are determined using quoted prices or identical quoted prices of assets or liabilities in active markets and are classified as Level 1. Fair value of corporate debt securities is determined using observable markets\u2019 inputs and is classified as Level 2. Investments in unquoted equity shares and limited liability pa/r_t.liganerships are classified as fair value through profit and loss and are classified as Level 3. The re-measurement is calculated using unobservable inputs based on the Group\u2019s own assessment of third pa/r_t.ligay valuations and respective company\u2019s financial pe/r_f.ligaormance. Derivative financial instruments: The Group\u2019s derivative financial instruments consist of foreign currency forward exchange contracts and options. Fair values for derivative financial instruments are based on counter pa/r_t.ligay quotations and are classified as Level 2. Fair value of contingent consideration: The fair value measurement of contingent consideration is determined using Level 3 inputs. The Group contingent consideration represents a component of the total purchase consideration for its various acquisitions. The measurement is calculated using unobservable inputs based on the Group\u2019s own assessment of achievement of ce/r_t.ligaain pe/r_f.ligaormance goals. Fair value of consideration payable for \u201cother financial liabilities\u201d is determined using Monte Carlo and Geometric Brownian model. The fair value measurement is determined using Level 3 Inputs. The Group assessed that fair value of cash and cash equivalent, loans, sho/r_t.liga-term deposits, trade receivables, unbilled receivables, other current financial assets, trade payables and other current financial liabilities approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the sho/r_t.liga-term maturities of these instruments.

The Group has a risk management policy to manage and mitigate these risks. The Group\u2019s risk management policy aims to reduce volatility in financial statements while maintaining balance between providing predictability in the Group\u2019s business plan along with reasonable pa/r_t.ligaicipation in market movement. Market risk Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Market risk comprises of currency risk and interest rate risk. The Group is primarily exposed to fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates. (i) Foreign currency risk Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of an exposure will fluctuate because of changes in exchange rates. The Group\u2019s exposure to the risk of changes in exchange rates relates primarily to the Group\u2019s operations in foreign subsidiaries. The exchange rate risk primarily arises from assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the respective entities and foreign currency forecasted revenue and cash flows. A significant po/r_t.ligaion of the Group revenue is in US Dollar, Pound Sterling (GBP) and Euro while a large po/r_t.ligaion of costs are in Indian rupees. The fluctuation in exchange rates in respect to India rupee may have potential impact on the statement of profit and loss and other comprehensive income and equity.

Appreciation/depreciation of 5% in respective foreign currencies with respect to functional currency of the Company and its subsidiaries would result in increase/decrease in the Group\u2019s profit before tax by approximately /uni20B9652 crores (31 March 2024,/uni20B9574 crores) for the year ended 31 March 2025. The rate sensitivity is calculated by aggregation of the net foreign exchange exposure and a simultaneous parallel foreign exchange rates shift of all the currencies by 5% against the respective functional currencies of the Company and its subsidiaries. The sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual change. Non-derivative foreign currency exposure as of 31 March 2025 and 31 March 2024 in major currencies is as below: Financial assets Financial liabilities 31 March 2025 31 March 2024 31 March 2025 31 March 2024 USD/INR 11,404 7 ,248 2,225 893 GBP/INR 516 664 65 61 EUR/INR 926 1,269 251 146 (ii) Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Group\u2019s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates arises on borrowings with floating interest rate which is not material. Credit risk Financial instruments that potentially subject the Group to concentration of credit risk consist principally of cash and bank balances, inter-corporate deposits, trade receivables, finance lease receivables, investment securities and derivative instruments. The cash resources of the Group are invested with mutual funds, banks, financial institutions and corporations after an evaluation of the credit risk. By their nature, all such financial instruments involve risks, including the credit risk of non-pe/r_f.ligaormance by counterpa/r_t.ligaies. The customers of the Group are primarily corporations based in the United States of America and Europe and accordingly, trade receivables, unbilled receivables and finance lease receivables are concentrated in the respective countries. The Group periodically assesses the financial reliability of customers, taking into account the financial condition, current economic trends, analysis of historical bad debts and ageing of trade receivables, unbilled receivables, contract assets and finance lease receivables. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of trade receivables, unbilled receivables and finance lease receivables. The Group also outsourced selected client related credit risks to financial markets through \u201cNon-recourse assignment\u201d of receivables. The allowance for lifetime expected credit loss on customer balances is as below: Y ear ended 31 March 2025 31 March 2024 Balance at the beginning of the year 522 466 Additional provision during the year 248 294 Deductions on account of write offs and collections (301) (254) T ranslation exchange differences (5) 16 Balance at the end of the year 464 522",

The accounting policies in relation to segment accounting are as under: (a) Segment revenue and expenses Segment revenue is directly a/t_t.ligaributable to the segment and segment expenses have been allocated to various segments on the basis of specific identification and wherever allocable, are appo/r_t.ligaioned to the segment on an appropriate basis. Segment revenue does not include other income. Unallocable expenses are not allocable to any segment and primarily include finance cost, and exchange differences.

(b) The Group is involved in various lawsuits, claims and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcome of which is inherently unce/r_t.ligaain. Some of these ma/t_t.ligaers include speculative and frivolous claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. The Group records a liability when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount. The Group reviews these provisions at least qua/r_t.ligaerly and adjusts these provisions accordingly to reflect the impact of negotiations, se/t_t.ligalements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information. The Group believes that the amount or estimable range of reasonably possible loss, will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on its business, consolidated financial position, results of the Group, or cash flows with respect to loss contingencies for legal and other contingencies as at 31 March 2025. (c) A wholly owned subsidiary (\u2018WOS\u2019) of the Company, having a VSAT License, had received a demand from Depa/r_t.ligament of T elecommunications (Do T) in February 2015 for FY 2011-12 and FY 2013-14 for an amount of /uni20B9133 crores, including penalty, interest and interest on penalty. In July 2021, the WOS has received a revised demand for an amount of /uni20B9346 crores after updating interest up to July 2021. Demand is primarily due to Do T including IT Services revenues and related exchange gains in Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR). In March 2022, the WOS received a favourable judgement from TDSAT se/t_t.ligaing aside the demand raised by Do T. In August 2023, Do T has filed an appeal against the order passed by TDSAT in the Hon\u2019ble Supreme Cou/r_t.liga. Appeal, including condonation of delay in filing the appeal, is yet to be admi/t_t.ligaed by Hon\u2019ble Supreme Cou/r_t.liga. Subsequent to this appeal, the WOS has obtained a legal opinion and is of the view that it should be able to defend its position in the above ma/t_t.ligaer. 3.35 Additional information under general instructions for the preparation of consolidated financial statements of Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013 S.
